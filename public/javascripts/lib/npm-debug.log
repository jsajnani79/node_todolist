36 silly resolved     readme: '# pulldown\n\nA way to get your favourite libraries and scripts from the internet, and fast.\n\nBuilt with &hearts; by [@jackfranklin](https://github.com/jackfranklin) and [@phuu](https://github.com/phuu).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/pulldown.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/pulldown)\n\nSupports Node 0.10.x and 0.8.x.\n\nThe following documentation is for using Pulldown as a CLI tool. If you\'d like documentation on the use of Pulldown as a module, please see MODULE_USAGE.md.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall pulldown globally using npm:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g pulldown\n```\n\nIf you get any errors (particularly if you are on Node 0.8), try updating `npm`:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g npm\n```\n\nThis gives you a `pulldown` command to use on your command line:\n\n```bash\n$ pulldown\n\n  Usage: pulldown <identifier>[::<file>] [<identifier>[::<file>], ...] [options]\n\n  An <identifier> can be a URL, a library name or a set.\n\n  Options:\n\n    -o, --output  output directory\n\n    -d, --dry-run  don\'t actually download the files\n\n    -v, --version  get the current pulldown version\n\n    -n, --noisy  verbose mode, basically\n\n  Example usage:\n\n    pulldown jquery             # Downloads jQuery\n    pulldown jquery::jq.js      # Downloads jQuery to jq.js\n    pulldown jquery angular.js  # Downloads jQuery and Angular.js\n    pulldown backbone           # Downloads jQuery, Underscore.js and Backbone.js\n    pulldown backbone -o js     # Downloads same as above, but into js/\n```\n\n## Downloading Libraries\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to jquery.min.js\n```\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery underscore\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to jquery.min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore/1.0.0/underscore.min.js was downloaded to underscore.min.js\n```\n\nPulldown works by searching on the [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/) site for what you asked it for.\n\n## Custom Downloads\n\nOf course, not everything you might want to download exists on cdnjs. You can add your own custom downloads to `~/.pulldown.json`. This file might look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "mycustommodule": "http://www.madeup.com/custom/module.js"\n}\n```\n\nThen you can run:\n\n```\n$ pulldown mycustommodule\n->  Success: http://www.madeup.com/custom/module.js was downloaded to module.js\n```\n\nPulldown will know where to look. Pulldown will always look in your local `~/.pulldown.json` file before searching. This means if you want a particular version of a library you can put it into your local file, and Pulldown will always use that.\n\n## Sets on the Server\n\nPulldown comes with the notion of _sets_. Sets are a collection of libraries.\n\nFor example, a Backbone application typically requires 3 libraries:\n\n- Backbone\n- jQuery\n- Underscore\n\nRather than download all three yourself, Pulldown has you covered:\n\n```\n$ pulldown backbone\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.4.4/underscore-min.js was downloaded to underscore-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js was downloaded to backbone-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to jquery.min.js\n```\n\nWe [define sets on our server](https://github.com/phuu/pulldown-api/blob/master/pulldown.json). When you hit our server asking for `backbone`, we give you back jQuery, Underscore and Backbone. If you think there\'s more sets we should support, [let us know](https://github.com/phuu/pulldown-api/issues/new).\n\n## Custom Sets\n\nYou can define custom sets in your `~/.pulldown.json`. They look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "backboneapp": ["jquery", "underscore", "backbone.js"]\n}\n```\n\nHere I define a custom set, `backboneapp`, that will download jQuery, Underscore and Backbone. This is an example we have on the server, so you don\'t need to, but it\'s useful for setting up common sets of libraries you use together. Downloading them all becomes as simple as:\n\n```\n$ pulldown backboneapp\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.4.4/underscore-min.js was downloaded to underscore-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js was downloaded to backbone-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to jquery.min.js\n```\n\n## Output Directories\n\nYou can tell Pulldown to save what it downloads into a directory, that will be created if it doesn\'t exist:\n\n```\n$ pulldown backbone -o foo/\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.4.4/underscore-min.js was downloaded to foo/underscore-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js was downloaded to foo/backbone-min.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to foo/jquery.min.js\n```\n\n## Custom File Names\n\nIf you\'re downloading something that will resolve to a single file, you can choose the name of the file that will be downloaded using two colons:\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery::foo.js\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js was downloaded to foo.js\n```\n\n## Versions\n\nPulldown supports finding a specific version of a library, and will do its best to find it. Use `identifier@version`:\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery@1.7.1\n->  Success: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js was downloaded to jquery.min.js\n```\n\nPulldown searches [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/) for it. If it can\'t find the right version, it\'ll give you the latest.\n\n## Dry Run\n\nIf you want to see what would happen when you run a particular command, append the `-d` or `--dry-run` flag. This will not download the files, but will tell you what would happen:\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery -d\n-> Dry Run - no files will be downloaded\n-> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js would have been downloaded to jquery.min.js\n```\n\n## Upgrading\n\n```\n$ npm update pulldown -g\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\n\n## Pulldown vs Bower\nWe get a lot of questions about the similarities and differences of Pulldown compared to Bower.\n\nShort Answer: Bower is a package manager; Pulldown downloads files. Bower configurations can be saved with a project and shared by people working on it; Pulldown cannot – it is almost configuration-less. Think of it as way to get a copy of your favourite library, fast.\n\nLong Answer: Bower is a far more complex and fully-featured package and, more importantly, dependency manager. If you have a complex project with multiple 3rd party libraries in play, and you want to keep tight control over the versions you\'re using, Bower is best suited. Use Bower when you wouldn\'t want to commit all those libraries to Git, but would want to commit a component.json file.\n\nWe envisage (and personally use) Pulldown for those times when you just want one or two libraries, and have little care for versioning or dependencies. For example, if I want to prototype a quick Backbone app, I can quickly run $ pulldown jquery underscore backbone.js to get all three. Here it doesn\'t matter to me which versions I have (Pulldown will always pull in the latest stable version by default) and I\'ll probably commit those libraries to Git too. Pulldown also has the concept of sets, which is often where people get confused. These two commands are equal:\n\n```\n$ pulldown jquery underscore backbone.js\n$ pulldown backbone\n```\n\nThe second command will download the Backbone set, which will give you Underscore, jQuery and Backbone. This looks like dependency management - and sort of is - but it\'s really dumb. All Pulldown is doing here is seeing you asked it for "backbone", and replacing that with "jquery underscore backbone.js", which it then goes and gets separately. Sets are hard coded in the [Pulldown API](https://github.com/phuu/pulldown-api/blob/master/pulldown.json#L4):\n\n```\n"backbone": ["backbone.js", "underscore", "jquery"],\n```\n\nThe sets are there purely to allow you to save time and type less. There is no versioning, dependency checks or anything done with sets. They are just a list of libraries to download, nothing more.\n\nRemember:\n\n- Pulldown: run once, commit libraries to source control.\n- Bower: add package to configuration file, don\'t commit libraries to source control, run often.\n\nIf you\'ve any further questions, please do ask.\n\n## Changelog\n\n__V1.1.0__\n- Deal better and show on command line any API errors and problems with Heroku\n\n__V1.0.4__\n- Fixed a bug that would show the help and not the version number when you ran `$ pulldown -v`.\n\n__V1.0.3__\n- If you downloaded a URL and passed an output name (eg `$ pulldown foo.com/bar.js::test.js`), it will now save the file to the specified name and not just ignore it (bug #74).\n\n__V1.0.2__\n- add `found: true` flag to the results returned from the `pulldown.init` callback. This enables you to see if a searchTerm was successful by seeing if `result.found === true`.\n\n__V1.0.1__\n- Fixed `TypeError` when you search for something that no longer exists ( Number #70 )\n- Improve handling of errors and the console output.\n\n__V1.0.0__\n- complete rewrite to separate Pulldown the module and Pulldown the CLI tool. The module is now responsible for searching the API and returning the contents of the library source. The CLI tool saves those to files and parses the command line arguments.\n- Various small bug fixes and tweaks.\n\n__V1.0.0rc1__\n- you can now run a dry-run to see what will happen with the flag `-d` or `--dry-run`: `$ pulldown -d jquery` (Number #40)\n- if you use 1 semi colon instead of 2 to split URL and output (eg `jquery:foo.js`), which is incorrect, you\'ll see a nice error message instead of a JS exception. (Number #33)\n- you can run `$ pulldown ls` to list the sets we support. (Number #38)\n- bug fixed: when downloading zips, the `-o` flag was ignored. (Number #41)\n- bug fixed: you can now specify complex paths to download a file to: `$ pulldown jquery::foo/bar/baz/jquery.js` (Number #42)\n\n__V0.6.0__\n- you can now programatically require Pulldown: `var Pulldown = require("pulldown")` (presuming it\'s in your package.json and installed as a dependency).\n- progress bars are shown when downloading a file\n\n__V0.5.0__\n- pulldown will now notify you when a new version is out and you should upgrade\n- swapped to using [chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk) for the coloured output\n\n__V0.4.0__\n- swapped to using `::` for seperating search term with output name\n- support URLs\n\n__V0.3.2__\n- allow help to be got at through `pulldown -h` or `pulldown --help`\n\n__V0.3.1__\n- added a help command (`pulldown`)\n- don\'t add `zip` extension to output path if it is already there\n\n__V0.3.0__\n- support downloading and unzipping of ZIP files.\n\n__V0.2.6__\n- only let the file name be dictated by the user if there\'s only one file to download\n\n__V0.2.5__\n- avoid downloading the same file more than once if we can avoid it\n\n__V0.2.4__\n- show an error if the search term could not be resolved\n\n__V0.2.3__\n- pass in an output directory to save all files to (`pulldown backbone -o foo/`)\n- support saving a file to a particular name (`pulldown jquery:foo.js`)\n\n__V0.2.2__\n- improve Windows support (thanks @sindresorhus)\n\n__V0.2.1__\n- make sure URLs in local JSON file are valid\n\n__V0.2.0__\n- _complete_ rewrite. Too much to document here (see this README for a full briefing on the new pulldown).\n\n__V0.1.2__\n- updated structure of `.pulldownrc` to allow for specifying the file name\n- fix `mkdir` showing error if no directory given\n\n__V0.1.1__\n- if you try to install something to a folder that doesn\'t exist, pulldown will now create it\n\n__V0.1.0__\n- initial release!\n- this is a rewrite and rework of the old `nodefetch` module, with a better name.\n\n',

341 silly resolved     readme: '# unzip [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nearinfinity/node-unzip.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nearinfinity/node-unzip)\n\nStreaming cross-platform unzip tool written in node.js.\n\nUnzip provides simple APIs similar to [node-tar](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar) for parsing and extracting zip files.\nThere are no added compiled dependencies - inflation is handled by node.js\'s built in zlib support.  Unzip is also an\nexample use case of [node-pullstream](https://github.com/nearinfinity/node-pullstream).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install unzip\n```\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n### Extract to a directory\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'path/to/archive.zip\').pipe(unzip.Extract({ path: \'output/path\' }));\n```\n\nExtract emits the \'close\' event once the zip\'s contents have been fully extracted to disk.\n\n### Parse zip file contents\n\nProcess each zip file entry or pipe entries to another stream.\n\n__Important__: If you do not intend to consume an entry stream\'s raw data, call autodrain() to dispose of the entry\'s\ncontents. Otherwise you risk running out of memory.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'path/to/archive.zip\')\n  .pipe(unzip.Parse())\n  .on(\'entry\', function (entry) {\n    var fileName = entry.path;\n    var type = entry.type; // \'Directory\' or \'File\'\n    var size = entry.size;\n    if (fileName === "this IS the file I\'m looking for") {\n      entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'output/path\'));\n    } else {\n      entry.autodrain();\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nOr pipe the output of unzip.Parse() to fstream\n\n```javascript\nvar readStream = fs.createReadStream(\'path/to/archive.zip\');\nvar writeStream = fstream.Writer(\'output/path\');\n\nreadStream\n  .pipe(unzip.Parse())\n  .pipe(writeStream)\n```\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 - 2013 Near Infinity Corporation\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

341 silly resolved     readme: '# update-notifier [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/update-notifier)\n\n##### Update notifier for your Node.js NPM package\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/yeoman/update-notifier/master/screenshot.png)\n\nInform your package users of updates in a non-intrusive way. Mainly targets global CLI apps.\n\nWhenever you initiate the update notifier and it\'s not within the interval threshold, it will asynchronously check with NPM in the background for available updates, then persist the result. The next time the notifier is initiated the result will be loaded into the `.update` property. This prevents any impact on your package startup performance.\nThe check process is done with [fork](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_fork). This means that if you call `process.exit`, the check will still be performed in its own process.\n\n\n## About\n\nThe idea for this module came from the desire to apply the browser update strategy to CLI tools, where everyone is always on the latest version. We first tried automatic updating, which we discovered wasn\'t popular. This is the second iteration of that idea, but limited to just update notifications.\n\nThere are a few projects using it:\n\n- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) - modern workflows for modern webapps\n\n- [Bower](http://bower.io) - a package manager for the web\n\n- [Automaton](https://github.com/IndigoUnited/automaton) - task automation tool\n\n- [Spoon.js CLI](https://npmjs.org/package/spoonjs)\n\n- [Node GH](http://nodegh.io) - GitHub command line tool\n\n- [Hoodie CLI](http://hood.ie) - Hoodie command line tool\n\n## Example usage\n\n```js\nvar updateNotifier = require(\'update-notifier\');\n\n// Checks for available update and returns an instance\nvar notifier = updateNotifier();\n\nif (notifier.update) {\n\t// Notify using the built-in convenience method\n\tnotifier.notify();\n}\n\n// `notifier.update` contains some useful info about the update\nconsole.log(notifier.update);\n/*\n{\n\tlatest: \'0.9.5\',\n\tcurrent: \'0.9.3\',\n\ttype: \'patch\', // possible values: latest, major, minor, patch\n\tdate: \'2012-11-05T14:32:37.603Z\',\n\tname: \'yeoman\'\n}\n*/\n```\n\n## Example with settings and custom message\n\n```js\nvar notifier = updateNotifier({\n\tupdateCheckInterval: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 1 week\n});\n\nif (notifier.update) {\n\tnotifier.notify(\'Update available: \' + notifier.update.latest);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n\n### updateNotifier([settings])\n\nChecks if there is an available update. Accepts settings defined below. Returns an object with update info if there is an available update, otherwise `undefined`.\n\n### updateNotifier.notify([message || defer])\n\nA convenience method that will inform the user about an available update (see screenshot). By default it will display the message right away. However, if you supply a custom message or `true` it will be displayed right before the process exits.\n\n\n### Settings\n\n\n#### callback\n\nType: `function`  \nDefault: `null`\n\nIf provided, a callback function will be called,\npassed `(error[, update])`\n\n`update` is equal to `notifier.update`\n\n\n#### packagePath\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: `\'package.json\'`\n\nRelative path to your module `package.json`.\n\n\n#### packageName\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: Inferred from `packageFile`\n\nUsed instead of inferring it from `packageFile`.  \nRequires you to also specify `packageVersion`.\n\n\n#### packageVersion\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: Inferred from `packageFile`\n\nUsed instead of inferring it from `packageFile`.  \nRequires you to also specify `packageName`.\n\n\n#### updateCheckInterval\n\nType: `number`  \nDefault: `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24` (1 day)\n\nHow often it should check for updates.\n\n\n#### updateCheckTimeout\n\nType: `number`  \nDefault: `20000` (20 secs)\n\nHow long the update can take.  \nIf it takes longer than the timeout, it will be aborted.\n\n#### registryUrl\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: `\'http://registry.npmjs.org/%s\'`\n\nAlternative registry mirrors:\n\n- `http://85.10.209.91/%s`\n- `http://165.225.128.50:8000/%s`\n\n\n### User settings\n\nUsers of your module have the ability to opt-out of the update notifier by changing the `optOut` property to `true` in `~/.config/configstore/update-notifier-[your-module-name].yml`. The path is available in `notifier.config.path`.\n\nYou could also let the user opt-out on a per run basis:\n\n```js\nif (process.argv.indexOf(\'--no-update-notifier\') === -1) {\n\t// run updateNotifier()\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) and copyright Google\n',

341 silly resolved     readme: '# ShellJS - Unix shell commands for Node.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/arturadib/shelljs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/arturadib/shelljs)\n\nShellJS is a **portable** (Windows included) implementation of Unix shell commands on top of the Node.js API. You can use it to eliminate your shell script\'s dependency on Unix while still keeping its familiar and powerful commands. You can also install it globally so you can run it from outside Node projects - say goodbye to those gnarly Bash scripts!\n\nThe project is [unit-tested](http://travis-ci.org/arturadib/shelljs) and is being used at Mozilla\'s [PDF.js](http://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js), [Butter.js](http://github.com/mozilla/butter) and [others](http://search.npmjs.org/#/shelljs).\n\n\n### Installing\n\nVia npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install [-g] shelljs\n```\n\nIf the global option `-g` is specified, the binary `shjs` will be installed. This makes it possible to\nrun ShellJS scripts much like any shell script from the command line, i.e. without requiring a `node_modules` folder:\n\n```bash\n$ shjs my_script\n```\n\nYou can also just copy `shell.js` into your project\'s directory, and `require()` accordingly.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n#### JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'shelljs/global\');\n\nif (!which(\'git\')) {\n  echo(\'Sorry, this script requires git\');\n  exit(1);\n}\n\n// Copy files to release dir\nmkdir(\'-p\', \'out/Release\');\ncp(\'-R\', \'stuff/*\', \'out/Release\');\n\n// Replace macros in each .js file\ncd(\'lib\');\nls(\'*.js\').forEach(function(file) {\n  sed(\'-i\', \'BUILD_VERSION\', \'v0.1.2\', file);\n  sed(\'-i\', /.*REMOVE_THIS_LINE.*\\n/, \'\', file);\n  sed(\'-i\', /.*REPLACE_LINE_WITH_MACRO.*\\n/, cat(\'macro.js\'), file);\n});\ncd(\'..\');\n\n// Run external tool synchronously\nif (exec(\'git commit -am "Auto-commit"\').code !== 0) {\n  echo(\'Error: Git commit failed\');\n  exit(1);\n}\n```\n\n#### CoffeeScript\n\n```coffeescript\nrequire \'shelljs/global\'\n\nif not which \'git\'\n  echo \'Sorry, this script requires git\'\n  exit 1\n\n# Copy files to release dir\nmkdir \'-p\', \'out/Release\'\ncp \'-R\', \'stuff/*\', \'out/Release\'\n\n# Replace macros in each .js file\ncd \'lib\'\nfor file in ls \'*.js\'\n  sed \'-i\', \'BUILD_VERSION\', \'v0.1.2\', file\n  sed \'-i\', /.*REMOVE_THIS_LINE.*\\n/, \'\', file\n  sed \'-i\', /.*REPLACE_LINE_WITH_MACRO.*\\n/, cat \'macro.js\', file\ncd \'..\'\n\n# Run external tool synchronously\nif (exec \'git commit -am "Auto-commit"\').code != 0\n  echo \'Error: Git commit failed\'\n  exit 1\n```\n\n### Global vs. Local\n\nThe example above uses the convenience script `shelljs/global` to reduce verbosity. If polluting your global namespace is not desirable, simply require `shelljs`.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar shell = require(\'shelljs\');\nshell.echo(\'hello world\');\n```\n\n### Make tool\n\nA convenience script `shelljs/make` is also provided to mimic the behavior of a Unix Makefile. In this case all shell objects are global, and command line arguments will cause the script to execute only the corresponding function in the global `target` object. To avoid redundant calls, target functions are executed only once per script.\n\nExample (CoffeeScript):\n\n```coffeescript\nrequire \'shelljs/make\'\n\ntarget.all = ->\n  target.bundle()\n  target.docs()\n\ntarget.bundle = ->\n  cd __dirname\n  mkdir \'build\'\n  cd \'lib\'\n  (cat \'*.js\').to \'../build/output.js\'\n\ntarget.docs = ->\n  cd __dirname\n  mkdir \'docs\'\n  cd \'lib\'\n  for file in ls \'*.js\'\n    text = grep \'//@\', file     # extract special comments\n    text.replace \'//@\', \'\'      # remove comment tags\n    text.to \'docs/my_docs.md\'\n```\n\nTo run the target `all`, call the above script without arguments: `$ node make`. To run the target `docs`: `$ node make docs`, and so on.\n\n\n\n<!-- \n\n  DO NOT MODIFY BEYOND THIS POINT - IT\'S AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED\n\n-->\n\n\n# Command reference\n\n\nAll commands run synchronously, unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n#### cd(\'dir\')\nChanges to directory `dir` for the duration of the script\n\n#### pwd()\nReturns the current directory.\n\n#### ls([options ,] path [,path ...])\n#### ls([options ,] path_array)\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `-R`: recursive\n+ `-a`: all files (include files beginning with `.`)\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nls(\'projs/*.js\');\nls(\'-R\', \'/users/me\', \'/tmp\');\nls(\'-R\', [\'/users/me\', \'/tmp\']); // same as above\n```\n\nReturns array of files in the given path, or in current directory if no path provided.\n\n#### find(path [,path ...])\n#### find(path_array)\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nfind(\'src\', \'lib\');\nfind([\'src\', \'lib\']); // same as above\nfind(\'.\').filter(function(file) { return file.match(/\\.js$/); });\n```\n\nReturns array of all files (however deep) in the given paths.\n\nThe main difference from `ls(\'-R\', path)` is that the resulting file names \ninclude the base directories, e.g. `lib/resources/file1` instead of just `file1`.\n\n#### cp(\'[options ,] source [,source ...], dest\')\n#### cp(\'[options ,] source_array, dest\')\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `-f`: force\n+ `-r, -R`: recursive\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\ncp(\'file1\', \'dir1\');\ncp(\'-Rf\', \'/tmp/*\', \'/usr/local/*\', \'/home/tmp\');\ncp(\'-Rf\', [\'/tmp/*\', \'/usr/local/*\'], \'/home/tmp\'); // same as above\n```\n\nCopies files. The wildcard `*` is accepted.\n\n#### rm([options ,] file [, file ...])\n#### rm([options ,] file_array)\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `-f`: force\n+ `-r, -R`: recursive\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nrm(\'-rf\', \'/tmp/*\');\nrm(\'some_file.txt\', \'another_file.txt\');\nrm([\'some_file.txt\', \'another_file.txt\']); // same as above\n```\n\nRemoves files. The wildcard `*` is accepted. \n\n#### mv(source [, source ...], dest\')\n#### mv(source_array, dest\')\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `f`: force\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nmv(\'-f\', \'file\', \'dir/\');\nmv(\'file1\', \'file2\', \'dir/\');\nmv([\'file1\', \'file2\'], \'dir/\'); // same as above\n```\n\nMoves files. The wildcard `*` is accepted.\n\n#### mkdir([options ,] dir [, dir ...])\n#### mkdir([options ,] dir_array)\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `p`: full path (will create intermediate dirs if necessary)\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nmkdir(\'-p\', \'/tmp/a/b/c/d\', \'/tmp/e/f/g\');\nmkdir(\'-p\', [\'/tmp/a/b/c/d\', \'/tmp/e/f/g\']); // same as above\n```\n\nCreates directories.\n\n#### test(expression)\nAvailable expression primaries:\n\n+ `\'-d\', \'path\'`: true if path is a directory\n+ `\'-f\', \'path\'`: true if path is a regular file\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nif (test(\'-d\', path)) { /* do something with dir */ };\nif (!test(\'-f\', path)) continue; // skip if it\'s a regular file\n```\n\nEvaluates expression using the available primaries and returns corresponding value.\n\n#### cat(file [, file ...])\n#### cat(file_array)\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar str = cat(\'file*.txt\');\nvar str = cat(\'file1\', \'file2\');\nvar str = cat([\'file1\', \'file2\']); // same as above\n```\n\nReturns a string containing the given file, or a concatenated string\ncontaining the files if more than one file is given (a new line character is\nintroduced between each file). Wildcard `*` accepted.\n\n#### \'string\'.to(file)\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\ncat(\'input.txt\').to(\'output.txt\');\n```\n\nAnalogous to the redirection operator `>` in Unix, but works with JavaScript strings (such as\nthose returned by `cat`, `grep`, etc). _Like Unix redirections, `to()` will overwrite any existing file!_\n\n#### sed([options ,] search_regex, replace_str, file)\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `-i`: Replace contents of \'file\' in-place. _Note that no backups will be created!_\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nsed(\'-i\', \'PROGRAM_VERSION\', \'v0.1.3\', \'source.js\');\nsed(/.*DELETE_THIS_LINE.*\\n/, \'\', \'source.js\');\n```\n\nReads an input string from `file` and performs a JavaScript `replace()` on the input\nusing the given search regex and replacement string. Returns the new string after replacement.\n\n#### grep([options ,] regex_filter, file [, file ...])\n#### grep([options ,] regex_filter, file_array)\nAvailable options:\n\n+ `-v`: Inverse the sense of the regex and print the lines not matching the criteria.\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\ngrep(\'-v\', \'GLOBAL_VARIABLE\', \'*.js\');\ngrep(\'GLOBAL_VARIABLE\', \'*.js\');\n```\n\nReads input string from given files and returns a string containing all lines of the \nfile that match the given `regex_filter`. Wildcard `*` accepted.\n\n#### which(command)\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar nodeExec = which(\'node\');\n```\n\nSearches for `command` in the system\'s PATH. On Windows looks for `.exe`, `.cmd`, and `.bat` extensions.\nReturns string containing the absolute path to the command.\n\n#### echo(string [,string ...])\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\necho(\'hello world\');\nvar str = echo(\'hello world\');\n```\n\nPrints string to stdout, and returns string with additional utility methods\nlike `.to()`.\n\n#### exit(code)\nExits the current process with the given exit code.\n\n#### env[\'VAR_NAME\']\nObject containing environment variables (both getter and setter). Shortcut to process.env.\n\n#### exec(command [, options] [, callback])\nAvailable options (all `false` by default):\n\n+ `async`: Asynchronous execution. Needs callback.\n+ `silent`: Do not echo program output to console.\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar version = exec(\'node --version\', {silent:true}).output;\n\nvar child = exec(\'some_long_running_process\', {async:true});\nchild.stdout.on(\'data\', function(data) { \n  /* ... do something with data ... */ \n});\n```\n\nExecutes the given `command` _synchronously_, unless otherwise specified. \nWhen in synchronous mode returns the object `{ code:..., output:... }`, containing the program\'s \n`output` (stdout + stderr)  and its exit `code`. Otherwise returns the child process object, and\nthe `callback` gets the arguments `(code, output)`.\n\n**Note:** For long-lived processes, it\'s best to run `exec()` asynchronously as\nthe current synchronous implementation uses a lot of CPU. This should be getting\nfixed soon.\n\n## Non-Unix commands\n\n\n#### tempdir()\nSearches and returns string containing a writeable, platform-dependent temporary directory.\nFollows Python\'s [tempfile algorithm](http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir).\n\n#### error()\nTests if error occurred in the last command. Returns `null` if no error occurred,\notherwise returns string explaining the error\n\n#### silent([state])\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar silentState = silent();\nsilent(true);\n/* ... */\nsilent(silentState); // restore old silent state\n```\n\nSuppresses all command output if `state = true`, except for `echo()` calls. \nReturns state if no arguments given.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n\n#### exists(path [, path ...])\n#### exists(path_array)\n\n_This function is being deprecated. Use `test()` instead._\n\nReturns true if all the given paths exist.\n\n#### verbose()\n\n_This function is being deprecated. Use `silent(false) instead.`_\n\nEnables all output (default)\n',

341 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser.\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about bind, not about async. If you are wondering how to\nmake async execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (npm):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5.

If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main\ncallback for the each function is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit null argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as each only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as each only no more than "limit" iterators will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that\n the first "limit" iterator functions will complete before any others are \nstarted.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - The maximum number of iterators to run at any time.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit null argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions\n  have finished, or an error has occurred.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through\nthe iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, \nan error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an\nerror to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately\ncalled with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however\nthe results array will be in the same order as the original array.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapLimit" />\n### mapLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as map only no more than "limit" iterators will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that\n the first "limit" iterator functions will complete before any others are \nstarted.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* limit - The maximum number of iterators to run at any time.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original array.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ select\n\nReturns a new array of all the values which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* callback(results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__alias:__ selectSeries\n\nThe same as filter only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as reject, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__aliases:__ inject, foldl\n\nReduces a list of values into a single value using an async iterator to return\neach successive step. Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This\nfunction only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to\nsplit a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal\nArray.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where\neach step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before\nreducing it then it\'s probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* memo - The initial state of the reduction.\n* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a\n  callback(err, reduction) which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main callback is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ foldr\n\nSame as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test. The\niterator is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return true will\nfire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original array (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original array is important then look at detectSeries.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value undefined if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n    // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as detect, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original array (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each value through an async iterator.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err, sortValue) which must be called once it\n  has completed with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort\n  criteria.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is the items from\n  the original array sorted by the values returned by the iterator calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n    fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n        callback(err, stats.mtime);\n    });\n}, function(err, results){\n    // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n    // modified date\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ any\n\nReturns true if at least one element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists. Once any iterator\ncall returns true, the main callback is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either true or false depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ all\n\nReturns true if every element in the array satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or\nfalse, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like path.exists.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over.\n* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* callback(result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on\n  the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.every([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], path.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then every file exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concat" />\n### concat(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies an iterator to each item in a list, concatenating the results. Returns the\nconcatenated list. The iterators are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of the arguments passed to the iterator function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* arr - An array to iterate over\n* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.\n  The iterator is passed a callback(err, results) which must be called once it \n  has completed with an error (which can be null) and an array of results.\n* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator\n  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the iterator function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n    // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as async.concat, but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run and the callback for the series is\nimmediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed,\nthe results are passed to the final callback as an array.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.series.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a callback(err, result) it must call on completion with an error (which can\n  be null) and an optional result value.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.series([\n    function(callback){\n        // do some stuff ...\n        callback(null, \'one\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        // do some more stuff ...\n        callback(null, \'two\');\n    }\n],\n// optional callback\nfunction(err, results){\n    // results is now equal to [\'one\', \'two\']\n});\n\n\n// an example using an object instead of an array\nasync.series({\n    one: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 1);\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    two: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 2);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n},\nfunction(err, results) {\n    // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallel(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun an array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous\nfunction has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its\ncallback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error.\nOnce the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an\narray.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\nasync.parallel.\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed \n  a callback(err, result) it must call on completion with an error (which can\n  be null) and an optional result value.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        }, 100);\n    }\n],\n// optional callback\nfunction(err, results){\n    // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n    // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n});\n\n\n// an example using an object instead of an array\nasync.parallel({\n    one: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 1);\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    two: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 2);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n},\nfunction(err, results) {\n    // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallelLimit(tasks, limit, [callback])\n\nThe same as parallel only the tasks are executed in parallel with a maximum of "limit" \ntasks executing at any time.\n\nNote that the tasks are not executed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first "limit" tasks will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed \n  a callback(err, result) it must call on completion with an error (which can\n  be null) and an optional result value.\n* limit - The maximum number of tasks to run at any time.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, while test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* test() - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of fn.\n* fn(callback) - A function to call each time the test passes. The function is\n  passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has completed with an \n  optional error argument.\n* callback(err) - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of fn has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar count = 0;\n\nasync.whilst(\n    function () { return count < 5; },\n    function (callback) {\n        count++;\n        setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n    },\n    function (err) {\n        // 5 seconds have passed\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doWhilst" />\n### doWhilst(fn, test, callback)\n\nThe post check version of whilst. To reflect the difference in the order of operations `test` and `fn` arguments are switched. `doWhilst` is to `whilst` as `do while` is to `while` in plain JavaScript.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call fn, until test returns true. Calls the callback when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of async.whilst.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doUntil" />\n### doUntil(fn, test, callback)\n\nLike doWhilst except the test is inverted. Note the argument ordering differs from `until`.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forever" />\n### forever(fn, callback)\n\nCalls the asynchronous function \'fn\' repeatedly, in series, indefinitely.\nIf an error is passed to fn\'s callback then \'callback\' is called with the\nerror, otherwise it will never be called.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the functions pass an error to the callback, the\nnext function is not executed and the main callback is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a \n  callback(err, result1, result2, ...) it must call on completion. The first\n  argument is an error (which can be null) and any further arguments will be \n  passed as arguments in order to the next task.\n* callback(err, [results]) - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.waterfall([\n    function(callback){\n        callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n        callback(null, \'three\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, callback){\n        // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n        callback(null, \'done\');\n    }\n], function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals \'done\'    \n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="compose" />\n### compose(fn1, fn2...)\n\nCreates a function which is a composition of the passed asynchronous\nfunctions. Each function consumes the return value of the function that\nfollows. Composing functions f(), g() and h() would produce the result of\nf(g(h())), only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values.\n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* functions... - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nfunction add1(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n + 1);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nfunction mul3(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n * 3);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nvar add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1);\n\nadd1mul3(4, function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 15\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="applyEach" />\n### applyEach(fns, args..., callback)\n\nApplies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling the\ncallback after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first\nargument then it will return a function which lets you pass in the\narguments as if it were a single function call.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fns - the asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments\n* args... - any number of separate arguments to pass to the function\n* callback - the final argument should be the callback, called when all\n  functions have completed processing\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], \'bucket\', callback);\n\n// partial application example:\nasync.each(\n    buckets,\n    async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]),\n    callback\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="applyEachSeries" />\n### applyEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as applyEach only the functions are applied in series.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the\nqueue will be processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all\nworkers are in progress, the task is queued until one is available. Once\na worker has completed a task, the task\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(task, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with an \n  optional error as an argument.\n* concurrency - An integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe queue object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* concurrency - an integer for determining how many worker functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a queue is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* unshift(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the front of the queue.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a cargo object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the payload limit). If the\nworker is in progress, the task is queued until it is available. Once\nthe worker has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* worker(tasks, callback) - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its callback(err) argument when finished, with \n  an optional error as an argument.\n* payload - An optional integer for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe cargo object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* length() - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* payload - an integer for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a cargo is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* push(task, [callback]) - add a new task to the queue, the callback is called\n  once the worker has finished processing the task.\n  instead of a single task, an array of tasks can be submitted. the respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* saturated - a callback that is called when the queue length hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued\n* empty - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue is given to a worker\n* drain - a callback that is called when the last item from the queue has returned from the worker\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running functions based on their requirements.\nEach function can optionally depend on other functions being completed first,\nand each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. If any of\nthe functions pass an error to their callback, that function will not complete\n(so any other functions depending on it will not run) and the main callback\nwill be called immediately with the error. Functions also receive an object\ncontaining the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a results object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the tasks object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. For example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\');\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling readFile with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to readFile in a function which does not forward the \nresults object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An object literal containing named functions or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The key\n  used for each function or array is used when specifying requirements. The \n  function receives two arguments: (1) a callback(err, result) which must be \n  called when finished, passing an error (which can be null) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a results object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* callback(err, results) - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. The callback will receive an error as an argument\n  if any tasks pass an error to their callback. Results will always be passed\n\tbut if an error occurred, no other tasks will be performed, and the results\n\tobject will only contain partial results.\n  \n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        // async code to get some data\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback){\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, filename);\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n    }]\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        // async code to get some data\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of async tasks using the auto function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier and makes the code more readable.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n\'peek\' the next iterator by doing iterator.next().\n\nThis function is used internally by the async module but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* tasks - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied, a useful\nshorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls the callback on a later loop around the event loop. In node.js this just\ncalls process.nextTick, in the browser it falls back to setImmediate(callback)\nif available, otherwise setTimeout(callback, 0), which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of the callback.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* callback - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the callback n times and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with async.map.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* n - The number of times to run the function.\n* callback - The function to call n times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as times only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in\nseries. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed\nprocessing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the function you to proxy and cache results from.\n* hasher - an optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results, it has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a memoized function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Comes handy in tests.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* fn - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.log and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.log is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an async function to the console using console.dir to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in node.js or\nin browsers that support console.dir and console.error (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, console.dir is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* function - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* arguments... - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of async back to its original value, returning a reference to the\nasync object.\n',

Currently the project is totally backward compatible with optimist but this may change in the future (if it does I will update this notice to inform you of this).

This is especially helpful for the non-option arguments in `argv._`.\n\n.describe(key, desc)\n--------------------\n\nDescribe a `key` for the generated usage information.\n\nOptionally `.describe()` can take an object that maps keys to descriptions.\n\n.options(key, opt)\n------------------\n\nInstead of chaining together `.alias().demand().default()`, you can specify\nkeys in `opt` for each of the chainable methods.\n\nFor example:\n\n````javascript\nvar argv = require(\'yargs\')\n    .options(\'f\', {\n        alias : \'file\',\n        default : \'/etc/passwd\',\n    })\n    .argv\n;\n````\n\nis the same as\n\n````javascript\nvar argv = require(\'yargs\')\n    .alias(\'f\', \'file\')\n    .default(\'f\', \'/etc/passwd\')\n    .argv\n;\n````\n\nOptionally `.options()` can take an object that maps keys to `opt` parameters.\n\n.usage(message)\n---------------\n\nSet a usage message to show which commands to use. Inside `message`, the string\n`$0` will get interpolated to the current script name or node command for the\npresent script similar to how `$0` works in bash or perl.\n\n.example(cmd, desc)\n-------------------\n\nGive some example invocations of your program. Inside `cmd`, the string\n`$0` will get interpolated to the current script name or node command for the\npresent script similar to how `$0` works in bash or perl.\nExamples will be printed out as part of the help message.\n\n.check(fn)\n----------\n\nCheck that certain conditions are met in the provided arguments.\n\n`fn` is called with two arguments, the parsed `argv` hash and an array of options and their aliases.\n\nIf `fn` throws or returns `false`, show the thrown error, usage information, and\nexit.\n\n.boolean(key)\n-------------\n\nInterpret `key` as a boolean. If a non-flag option follows `key` in\n`process.argv`, that string won\'t get set as the value of `key`.\n\nIf `key` never shows up as a flag in `process.arguments`, `argv[key]` will be\n`false`.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as booleans.\n\n.string(key)\n------------\n\nTell the parser logic not to interpret `key` as a number or boolean.\nThis can be useful if you need to preserve leading zeros in an input.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as strings.\n\n.config(key)\n------------\n\nTells the parser to interpret `key` as a path to a JSON config file. The file\nis loaded and parsed, and its properties are set as arguments.\n\n.wrap(columns)\n--------------\n\nFormat usage output to wrap at `columns` many columns.\n\n.help()\n-------\n\nReturn the generated usage string.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nvar yargs = require("yargs")\n       .usage("$0 -operand1 number -operand2 number -operation [add|subtract]");\nconsole.log(yargs.help());\n```\n\nLater on, ```argv``` can be retrived with ```yargs.argv```\n\n.showHelp(fn=console.error)\n---------------------------\n\nPrint the usage data using `fn` for printing.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nvar yargs = require("yargs")\n       .usage("$0 -operand1 number -operand2 number -operation [add|subtract]");\nyargs.showHelp();\n```\n\nLater on, ```argv``` can be retrived with ```yargs.argv```\n\n.parse(args)\n------------\n\nParse `args` instead of `process.argv`. Returns the `argv` object.\n\n.argv\n-----\n\nGet the arguments as a plain old object.\n\nArguments without a corresponding flag show up in the `argv._` array.\n\nThe script name or node command is available at `argv.$0` similarly to how `$0`\nworks in bash or perl.\n\nparsing tricks\n==============\n\nstop parsing\n------------\n\nUse `--` to stop parsing flags and stuff the remainder into `argv._`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a 1 -b 2 -- -c 3 -d 4\n    { _: [ \'-c\', \'3\', \'-d\', \'4\' ],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: 1,\n      b: 2 }\n\nnegate fields\n-------------\n\nIf you want to explicity set a field to false instead of just leaving it\nundefined or to override a default you can do `--no-key`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a --no-b\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: true,\n      b: false }\n\nnumbers\n-------\n\nEvery argument that looks like a number (`!isNaN(Number(arg))`) is converted to\none. This way you can just `net.createConnection(argv.port)` and you can add\nnumbers out of `argv` with `+` without having that mean concatenation,\nwhich is super frustrating.\n\nduplicates\n----------\n\nIf you specify a flag multiple times it will get turned into an array containing\nall the values in order.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -x 5 -x 8 -x 0\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n        x: [ 5, 8, 0 ] }\n\ndot notation\n------------\n\nWhen you use dots (`.`s) in argument names, an implicit object path is assumed.\nThis lets you organize arguments into nested objects.\n\n     $ node examples/reflect.js --foo.bar.baz=33 --foo.quux=5\n     { _: [],\n       \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n         foo: { bar: { baz: 33 }, quux: 5 } }\n\nshort numbers\n-------------\n\nShort numeric `head -n5` style argument work too:\n\n    $ node reflect.js -n123 -m456\n    { \'3\': true,\n      \'6\': true,\n      _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./reflect.js\',\n      n: 123,\n      m: 456 }\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nWith [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:\n\n    npm install yargs\n \nor clone this project on github:\n\n    git clone http://github.com/chevex/yargs.git\n\nTo run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso),\njust do:\n    \n    expresso\n\ninspired By\n===========\n\nThis module is loosely inspired by Perl\'s\n[Getopt::Casual](http://search.cpan.org/~photo/Getopt-Casual-0.13.1/Casual.pm).\n',

It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```javascript\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also pipe to itself. When doing so the content-type and content-length will be preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let\'s get fancy.\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    } \n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also pipe() from a http.ServerRequest instance and to a http.ServerResponse instance. The HTTP method and headers will be sent as well as the entity-body data. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since pipe() returns the destination stream in node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying :)\n\n```javascript\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n```javascript\n// Twitter OAuth\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Assume by some stretch of magic you aquired the verifier\n  var access_token = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth = \n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: access_token.oauth_token\n      , verifier: VERIFIER\n      , token_secret: access_token.oauth_token_secret\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    var perm_token = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth = \n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_token.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_token.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json?\'\n      , params = \n        { screen_name: perm_token.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_token.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    url += qs.stringify(params)\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a url or an options object. The only required option is uri, all others are optional.\n\n* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from url.parse()\n* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the uri\n* `method` - http method, defaults to GET\n* `headers` - http headers, defaults to {}\n* `body` - entity body for POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string.\n* `form` - sets `body` but to querystring representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8` header.\n* `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as json.\n* `multipart` - (experimental) array of objects which contains their own headers and `body` attribute. Sends `multipart/related` request. See example below.\n* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to true.\n* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to false.\n* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow, defaults to 10.\n* `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If set to `null`, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n* `pool` - A hash object containing the agents for these requests. If omitted this request will use the global pool which is set to node\'s default maxSockets.\n* `pool.maxSockets` - Integer containing the maximum amount of sockets in the pool.\n* `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request\t\n* `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Support proxy Auth with Basic Auth the same way it\'s supported with the `url` parameter by embedding the auth info in the uri.\n* `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing, see documentation above.\n* `strictSSL` - Set to `true` to require that SSL certificates be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that ca as an option.\n* `jar` - Set to `false` if you don\'t want cookies to be remembered for future use or define your custom cookie jar (see examples section)\n\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments. The first is an error when applicable (usually from the http.Client option not the http.ClientRequest object). The second in an http.ClientResponse object. The third is the response body String or Buffer.\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n### request.defaults(options)  \n  \nThis method returns a wrapper around the normal request API that defaults to whatever options you pass in to it.\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nAlias to normal request method for uniformity.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.cookie(\'cookie_string_here\')\n```\n### request.jar\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart: \n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ] \n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\nCookies are enabled by default (so they can be used in subsequent requests). To disable cookies set jar to false (either in defaults or in the options sent).\n\n```javascript\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: false})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nIf you to use a custom cookie jar (instead of letting request use its own global cookie jar) you do so by setting the jar default or by specifying it as an option:\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\nOR\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'your_cookie_here\')\nj.add(cookie)\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n',

783 silly resolved     readme: '# Request -- Simplified HTTP request method\n\n## Install\n\n<pre>\n  npm install request\n</pre>\n\nOr from source:\n\n<pre>\n  git clone git://github.com/mikeal/request.git \n  cd request\n  npm link\n</pre>\n\n## Super simple to use\n\nRequest is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```javascript\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also pipe to itself. When doing so the content-type and content-length will be preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let\'s get fancy.\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    } \n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also pipe() from a http.ServerRequest instance and to a http.ServerResponse instance. The HTTP method and headers will be sent as well as the entity-body data. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since pipe() returns the destination stream in node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying :)\n\n```javascript\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\nUrl encoded forms are simple\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n```\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). You don\'t need to worry about piping the form object or setting the headers, `request` will handle that for you.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\')\nvar form = r.form()\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\')\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]))\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, \'doodle.png\'))\nform.append(\'remote_file\', request(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\'))\n```\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```javascript\nrequest.auth(\'username\', \'password\', false).get(\'http://some.server.com/\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values `user` || `username`, `password` || `pass`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  The method form takes parameters `auth(username, password, sendImmediately)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to true, which will cause a basic authentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then `request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a 401 response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header indicating the required authentication method).\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately` set to `false` (otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the initial request, which will probably cause the request to fail).\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n```javascript\n// Twitter OAuth\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has \n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n  var access_token = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth = \n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: access_token.oauth_token\n      , verifier: access_token.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    var perm_token = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth = \n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_token.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_token.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json?\'\n      , params = \n        { screen_name: perm_token.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_token.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    url += qs.stringify(params)\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a url or an options object. The only required option is uri, all others are optional.\n\n* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from url.parse()\n* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the uri\n* `method` - http method, defaults to GET\n* `headers` - http headers, defaults to {}\n* `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string.\n* `form` - when passed an object this will set `body` but to a querystring representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8` header. When passed no option a FormData instance is returned that will be piped to request.\n* `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `password` || `pass`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n* `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as json.\n* `multipart` - (experimental) array of objects which contains their own headers and `body` attribute. Sends `multipart/related` request. See example below.\n* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to true.\n* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to false.\n* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow, defaults to 10.\n* `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If set to `null`, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n* `pool` - A hash object containing the agents for these requests. If omitted this request will use the global pool which is set to node\'s default maxSockets.\n* `pool.maxSockets` - Integer containing the maximum amount of sockets in the pool.\n* `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request\t\n* `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Support proxy Auth with Basic Auth the same way it\'s supported with the `url` parameter by embedding the auth info in the uri.\n* `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing, see documentation above.\n* `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n* `strictSSL` - Set to `true` to require that SSL certificates be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that ca as an option.\n* `jar` - Set to `false` if you don\'t want cookies to be remembered for future use or define your custom cookie jar (see examples section)\n* `aws` - object containing aws signing information, should have the properties `key` and `secret` as well as `bucket` unless you\'re specifying your bucket as part of the path, or you are making a request that doesn\'t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services)\n* `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n* `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments. The first is an error when applicable (usually from the http.Client option not the http.ClientRequest object). The second in an http.ClientResponse object. The third is the response body String or Buffer.\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n### request.defaults(options)  \n  \nThis method returns a wrapper around the normal request API that defaults to whatever options you pass in to it.\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nAlias to normal request method for uniformity.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.cookie(\'cookie_string_here\')\n```\n### request.jar\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart: \n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ] \n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\nCookies are enabled by default (so they can be used in subsequent requests). To disable cookies set jar to false (either in defaults or in the options sent).\n\n```javascript\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: false})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nIf you to use a custom cookie jar (instead of letting request use its own global cookie jar) you do so by setting the jar default or by specifying it as an option:\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\nOR\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'your_cookie_here\')\nj.add(cookie)\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n',

837 silly resolved     readme: '# Request -- Simplified HTTP request method\n\n## Install\n\n<pre>\n  npm install request\n</pre>\n\nOr from source:\n\n<pre>\n  git clone git://github.com/mikeal/request.git \n  cd request\n  npm link\n</pre>\n\n## Super simple to use\n\nRequest is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require(\'request\');\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function (error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    console.log(body) // Print the google web page.\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Streaming\n\nYou can stream any response to a file stream.\n\n```javascript\nrequest(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nYou can also stream a file to a PUT or POST request. This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types, in this case `application/json`, and use the proper content-type in the PUT request if one is not already provided in the headers.\n\n```javascript\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also pipe to itself. When doing so the content-type and content-length will be preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let\'s get fancy.\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    } \n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also pipe() from a http.ServerRequest instance and to a http.ServerResponse instance. The HTTP method and headers will be sent as well as the entity-body data. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since pipe() returns the destination stream in node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying :)\n\n```javascript\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\nUrl encoded forms are simple\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n```\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). You don\'t need to worry about piping the form object or setting the headers, `request` will handle that for you.\n\n```javascript\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\')\nvar form = r.form()\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\')\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]))\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, \'doodle.png\'))\nform.append(\'remote_file\', request(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\'))\n```\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values `user` || `username`, `password` || `pass`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  The method form takes parameters `auth(username, password, sendImmediately)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to true, which will cause a basic authentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then `request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a 401 response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header indicating the required authentication method).\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately` set to `false` (otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the initial request, which will probably cause the request to fail).\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n```javascript\n// Twitter OAuth\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has \n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n  var access_token = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth = \n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: access_token.oauth_token\n      , verifier: access_token.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    var perm_token = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth = \n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_token.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_token.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json?\'\n      , params = \n        { screen_name: perm_token.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_token.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    url += qs.stringify(params)\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a url or an options object. The only required option is uri, all others are optional.\n\n* `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from url.parse()\n* `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the uri\n* `method` - http method, defaults to GET\n* `headers` - http headers, defaults to {}\n* `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be buffer or string.\n* `form` - when passed an object this will set `body` but to a querystring representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8` header. When passed no option a FormData instance is returned that will be piped to request.\n* `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `password` || `pass`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n* `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as json.\n* `multipart` - (experimental) array of objects which contains their own headers and `body` attribute. Sends `multipart/related` request. See example below.\n* `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to true.\n* `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects. defaults to false.\n* `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow, defaults to 10.\n* `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If set to `null`, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n* `pool` - A hash object containing the agents for these requests. If omitted this request will use the global pool which is set to node\'s default maxSockets.\n* `pool.maxSockets` - Integer containing the maximum amount of sockets in the pool.\n* `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request\t\n* `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Support proxy Auth with Basic Auth the same way it\'s supported with the `url` parameter by embedding the auth info in the uri.\n* `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing, see documentation above.\n* `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n* `strictSSL` - Set to `true` to require that SSL certificates be valid. Note: to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that ca as an option.\n* `jar` - Set to `false` if you don\'t want cookies to be remembered for future use or define your custom cookie jar (see examples section)\n* `aws` - object containing aws signing information, should have the properties `key` and `secret` as well as `bucket` unless you\'re specifying your bucket as part of the path, or you are making a request that doesn\'t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services)\n* `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n* `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments. The first is an error when applicable (usually from the http.Client option not the http.ClientRequest object). The second in an http.ClientResponse object. The third is the response body String or Buffer.\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n### request.defaults(options)  \n  \nThis method returns a wrapper around the normal request API that defaults to whatever options you pass in to it.\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as request() but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nAlias to normal request method for uniformity.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.cookie(\'cookie_string_here\')\n```\n### request.jar\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```javascript\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart: \n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ] \n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\nCookies are enabled by default (so they can be used in subsequent requests). To disable cookies set jar to false (either in defaults or in the options sent).\n\n```javascript\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: false})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nIf you to use a custom cookie jar (instead of letting request use its own global cookie jar) you do so by setting the jar default or by specifying it as an option:\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\nOR\n\n```javascript\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'your_cookie_here\')\nj.add(cookie)\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n',

Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.\n\n**Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**\n\n![screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n\n## Why\n\n- **Doesn\'t extend String.prototype**\n- Expressive API\n- Auto-detects color support\n- Actively maintained\n\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/chalk): `npm install --save chalk`\n\n\n## Example\n\nChalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain the styles you want.\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require(\'chalk\');\n\n// style a string\nconsole.log(chalk.blue(\'Hello world!\'));\n\n// combine styled and normal strings\nconsole.log(chalk.blue(\'Hello\') + \'World\' + chalk.red(\'!\'));\n\n// compose multiple styles using the chainable API\nconsole.log(chalk.blue.bgRed.bold(\'Hello world!\'));\n```\n\nYou can easily define your own themes.\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require(\'chalk\');\nvar error = chalk.bold.red;\nconsole.log(error(\'Error!\'));\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### chalk.\\<style\\>\\[.\\<style\\>...\\](*string*)\n\nChain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument.\n\n\n### chalk.enabled\n\nColor support is automatically detected, but you can override it.\n\n### chalk.supportsColor\n\nDetect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-color).\n\nCan be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.\n\nUsed internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.\n\n### chalk.styles\n\nExposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require(\'chalk\');\nconsole.log(chalk.styles.red);\n//=> \\x1b[31m\n```\n\n### chalk.stripColor(*string*)\n\nStrip color from a string.\n\n\n## Styles\n\n### General\n\n- reset\n- bold\n- italic\n- underline\n- blink\n- inverse\n- strikethrough\n\n### Text colors\n\n- black\n- red\n- green\n- yellow\n- blue\n- magenta\n- cyan\n- white\n- default\n- gray\n\n### Background colors\n\n- bgBlack\n- bgRed\n- bgGreen\n- bgYellow\n- bgBlue\n- bgMagenta\n- bgCyan\n- bgWhite\n- bgDefault\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License • © [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)\n',

In that case, only a single\n    version may be used, and it is incremented by the specified level\n\n    Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies\n    all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.\n\n    If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,\n    then exits failure.\n\n    Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying\n    multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.\n\n## Versions\n\nA "version" is described by the v2.0.0 specification found at\n<http://semver.org/>.\n\nA leading `"="` or `"v"` character is stripped off and ignored.\n\n## Ranges\n\nThe following range styles are supported:\n\n* `1.2.3` A specific version.  When nothing else will do.  Note that\n  build metadata is still ignored, so `1.2.3+build2012` will satisfy\n  this range.\n* `>1.2.3` Greater than a specific version.\n* `<1.2.3` Less than a specific version.  If there is no prerelease\n  tag on the version range, then no prerelease version will be allowed\n  either, even though these are technically "less than".\n* `>=1.2.3` Greater than or equal to.  Note that prerelease versions\n  are NOT equal to their "normal" equivalents, so `1.2.3-beta` will\n  not satisfy this range, but `2.3.0-beta` will.\n* `<=1.2.3` Less than or equal to.  In this case, prerelease versions\n  ARE allowed, so `1.2.3-beta` would satisfy.\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3-0 <1.3.0-0`  "Reasonably close to 1.2.3".  When\n  using tilde operators, prerelease versions are supported as well,\n  but a prerelease of the next significant digit will NOT be\n  satisfactory, so `1.3.0-beta` will not satisfy `~1.2.3`.\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` "Any version starting with 1.2"\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` "Any version starting with 1.2"\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` "Any version starting with 1"\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` "Any version starting with 1"\n\n\nRanges can be joined with either a space (which implies "and") or a\n`||` (which implies "or").\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* valid(v): Return the parsed version, or null if it\'s not valid.\n* inc(v, release): Return the version incremented by the release type\n  (major, minor, patch, or prerelease), or null if it\'s not valid.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* gt(v1, v2): `v1 > v2`\n* gte(v1, v2): `v1 >= v2`\n* lt(v1, v2): `v1 < v2`\n* lte(v1, v2): `v1 <= v2`\n* eq(v1, v2): `v1 == v2` This is true if they\'re logically equivalent,\n  even if they\'re not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* neq(v1, v2): `v1 != v2` The opposite of eq.\n* cmp(v1, comparator, v2): Pass in a comparison string, and it\'ll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `"==="` and `"!=="` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* compare(v1, v2): Return 0 if v1 == v2, or 1 if v1 is greater, or -1 if\n  v2 is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to Array.sort().\n* rcompare(v1, v2): The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to Array.sort().\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* validRange(range): Return the valid range or null if it\'s not valid\n* satisfies(version, range): Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* maxSatisfying(versions, range): Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or null if none of them do.\n',

Calls `hostname` if not found.\n\n## osenv.user()\n\nThe currently logged-in user.  Calls `whoami` if not found.\n\n## osenv.prompt()\n\nEither PS1 on unix, or PROMPT on Windows.\n\n## osenv.tmpdir()\n\nThe place where temporary files should be created.\n\n## osenv.home()\n\nNo place like it.\n\n## osenv.path()\n\nAn array of the places that the operating system will search for\nexecutables.\n\n## osenv.editor() \n\nReturn the executable name of the editor program.  This uses the EDITOR\nand VISUAL environment variables, and falls back to `vi` on Unix, or\n`notepad.exe` on Windows.\n\n## osenv.shell()\n\nThe SHELL on Unix, which Windows calls the ComSpec.  Defaults to \'bash\'\nor \'cmd\'.\n',

1244 silly resolved     readme: 'JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser and serializer for JavaScript\n=======================================================\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml)\n\n[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)\n\n\nThis is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data\nserialization language. Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was\ncompletely rewritten from scratch. Now it\'s very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### YAML module for node.js\n\n```\nnpm install js-yaml\n```\n\n\n### CLI executable\n\nIf you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:\n\n```\nnpm install js-yaml -g\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nusage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-j] [-t] file\n\nPositional arguments:\n  file           File with YAML document(s)\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.\n  -v, --version  Show program\'s version number and exit.\n  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode\n  -j, --to-json  Output a non-funky boring JSON\n  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error\n```\n\n\n### Bundled YAML library for browsers\n\n``` html\n<script src="js-yaml.min.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\nvar doc = jsyaml.load(\'greeting: hello\\nname: world\');\n</script>\n```\n\nBrowser support was done mostly for online demo. If you find any errors - feel\nfree to send pull requests with fixes. Also note, that IE and other old browsers\nneeds [es5-shims](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) to operate.\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nHere we cover the most \'useful\' methods. If you need advanced details (creating\nyour own tags), see [wiki](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/wiki) and\n[examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples) for more\ninfo.\n\nIn node.js JS-YAML automatically registers handlers for `.yml` and `.yaml`\nfiles. You can load them just with `require`. That\'s mostly equivalent to\ncalling `safeLoad()` on fetched content of a file. Just with one string!\n\n``` javascript\nrequire(\'js-yaml\');\n\n// Get document, or throw exception on error\ntry {\n  var doc = require(\'/home/ixti/example.yml\');\n  console.log(doc);\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(e);\n}\n```\n\n\n### safeLoad (string [ , options ])\n\n**Recommended loading way.** Parses `string` as single YAML document. Returns a JavaScript\nobject or throws `YAMLException` on error. By default, does not support regexps,\nfunctions and undefined. This method is safe for untrusted data.\n\noptions:\n\n- `filename` _(default: null)_ - string to be used as a file path in\n  error/warning messages.\n- `strict` _(default - false)_ makes the loader to throw errors instead of\n  warnings.\n- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA`)_ - specifies a schema to use.\n  - `FAILSAFE_SCHEMA` - only strings, arrays and plain objects:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346\n  - `JSON_SCHEMA` - all JSON-supported types:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231\n  - `CORE_SCHEMA` - same as `JSON_SCHEMA`:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2804923\n  - `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA` - all supported YAML types, without unsafe ones\n    (`!!js/undefined`, `!!js/regexp` and `!!js/function`):\n    http://yaml.org/type/\n  - `DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` - all supported YAML types.\n\nNOTE: This function **does not** understand multi-document sources, it throws\nexception on those.\n\nNOTE: JS-YAML **does not** support schema-specific tag resolution restrictions.\nSo, JSON schema is not such strict as defined in the YAML specification.\nIt allows numbers in any notaion, use `Null` and `NULL` as `null`, etc.\nCore schema also has no such restrictions. It allows binary notation for integers.\n\n\n### load (string [ , options ])\n\n**Use with care with untrusted sources**. The same as `safeLoad()` but uses\n`DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` by default - adds some JavaScript-specific types:\n`!!js/function`, `!!js/regexp` and `!!js/undefined`. For untrusted sources you\nmust additionally validate object structure, to avoid injections:\n\n``` javascript\nvar untrusted_code = \'"toString": !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> "function (){very_evil_thing();}"\';\n\n// I\'m just converting that string, what could possibly go wrong?\nrequire(\'js-yaml\').load(untrusted_code) + \'\'\n```\n\n\n### safeLoadAll (string, iterator [ , options ])\n\nSame as `safeLoad()`, but understands multi-document sources and apply\n`iterator` to each document.\n\n``` javascript\nvar yaml = require(\'js-yaml\');\n\nyaml.safeLoadAll(data, function (doc) {\n  console.log(doc);\n});\n```\n\n\n### loadAll (string, iterator [ , options ])\n\nSame as `safeLoadAll()` but uses `DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` by default.\n\n\n### safeDump (object [ , options ])\n\nSerializes `object` as YAML document. Uses `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA`, so it will\nthrow exception if you try to dump regexps or functions. However, you can\ndisable exceptions by `skipInvalid` option.\n\noptions:\n\n- `indent` _(default: 2)_ - indentation width to use (in spaces).\n- `skipInvalid` _(default: false)_ - do not throw on invalid types (like function\n  in the safe schema) and skip pairs and single values with such types.\n- `flowLevel` (default: -1) - specifies level of nesting, when to switch from\n  block to flow style for collections. -1 means block style everwhere\n- `styles` - "tag" => "style" map. Each tag may have own set of styles.\n- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA`)_ specifies a schema to use.\n\nstyles:\n\n``` none\n!!null\n  "canonical"   => "~"\n\n!!int\n  "binary"      => "0b1", "0b101010", "0b1110001111010"\n  "octal"       => "01", "052", "016172"\n  "decimal"     => "1", "42", "7290"\n  "hexadecimal" => "0x1", "0x2A", "0x1C7A"\n\n!!null, !!bool, !!float\n  "lowercase"   => "null", "true", "false", ".nan", \'.inf\'\n  "uppercase"   => "NULL", "TRUE", "FALSE", ".NAN", \'.INF\'\n  "camelcase"   => "Null", "True", "False", ".NaN", \'.Inf\'\n```\n\nBy default, !!int uses `decimal`, and !!null, !!bool, !!float use `lowercase`.\n\n\n\n### dump (object [ , options ])\n\nSame as `safeDump()` but without limits (uses `DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` by default).\n\n\nSupported YAML types\n--------------------\n\nThe list of standard YAML tags and corresponding JavaScipt types. See also\n[YAML tag discussion](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/YAMLTagDiscussion) and\n[YAML types repository](http://yaml.org/type/).\n\n```\n!!null \'\'                   # null\n!!bool \'yes\'                # bool\n!!int \'3...\'                # number\n!!float \'3.14...\'           # number\n!!binary \'...base64...\'     # buffer\n!!timestamp \'YYYY-...\'      # date\n!!omap [ ... ]              # array of key-value pairs\n!!pairs [ ... ]             # array or array pairs\n!!set { ... }               # array of objects with given keys and null values\n!!str \'...\'                 # string\n!!seq [ ... ]               # array\n!!map { ... }               # object\n```\n\n**JavaScript-specific tags**\n\n```\n!!js/regexp /pattern/gim            # RegExp\n!!js/undefined \'\'                   # Undefined\n!!js/function \'function () {...}\'   # Function\n```\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nNote, that you use arrays or objects as key in JS-YAML. JS do not allows objects\nor array as keys, and stringifies (by calling .toString method) them at the\nmoment of adding them.\n\n``` yaml\n---\n? [ foo, bar ]\n: - baz\n? { foo: bar }\n: - baz\n  - baz\n```\n\n``` javascript\n{ "foo,bar": ["baz"], "[object Object]": ["baz", "baz"] }\n```\n\nAlso, reading of properties on implicit block mapping keys is not supported yet.\nSo, the following YAML document cannot be loaded.\n\n``` yaml\n&anchor foo:\n  foo: bar\n  *anchor: duplicate key\n  baz: bat\n  *anchor: duplicate key\n```\n\n\nBreaking changes in 1.x.x -> 2.0.x\n----------------------------------\n\nIf your have not used __custom__ tags or loader classes - no changes needed. Just\nupgrade library and enjoy high parse speed.\n\nIn other case, you should rewrite your tag constructors and custom loader\nclasses, to conform new schema-based API. See\n[examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples) and\n[wiki](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/wiki) for details.\nNote, that parser internals were completely rewritten.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nView the [LICENSE](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/blob/master/LICENSE) file\n(MIT).\n',

Returns a chainable interface with the\nmethods below plus a `vars` field to get at the variable stash as the last item\nin a chain.\n\nIn parse mode, methods will set their keys to `null` if the buffer isn\'t big\nenough except `buffer()` and `scan()` which read up up to the end of the buffer\nand stop.\n\nb.word{8,16,32,64}{l,b}{e,u,s}(key)\n-----------------------------------\n\nParse bytes in the buffer or stream given:\n\n* number of bits\n* endianness ( l : little, b : big ),\n* signedness ( u and e : unsigned, s : signed )\n\nThese functions won\'t start parsing until all previous parser functions have run\nand the data is available.\n\nThe result of the parse goes into the variable stash at `key`.\nIf `key` has dots (`.`s), it refers to a nested address. If parent container\nvalues don\'t exist they will be created automatically, so for instance you can\nassign into `dst.addr` and `dst.port` and the `dst` key in the variable stash\nwill be `{ addr : x, port : y }` afterwards.\n\nb.buffer(key, size)\n-------------------\n\nTake `size` bytes directly off the buffer stream, putting the resulting buffer\nslice in the variable stash at `key`. If `size` is a string, use the value at\n`vars[size]`. The key follows the same dotted address rules as the word\nfunctions.\n\nb.scan(key, buffer)\n-------------------\n\nSearch for `buffer` in the stream and store all the intervening data in the\nstash at at `key`, excluding the search buffer. If `buffer` passed as a string,\nit will be converted into a Buffer internally.\n\nFor example, to read in a line you can just do:\n\n``` js\nvar b = binary()\n    .scan(\'line\', new Buffer(\'\\r\\n\'))\n    .tap(function (vars) {\n        console.log(vars.line)\n    })\n;\nstream.pipe(b);\n```\n\nb.tap(cb)\n---------\n\nThe callback `cb` is provided with the variable stash from all the previous\nactions once they\'ve all finished.\n\nYou can nest additional actions onto `this` inside the callback.\n\nb.into(key, cb)\n---------------\n\nLike `.tap()`, except all nested actions will assign into a `key` in the `vars`\nstash.\n\nb.loop(cb)\n----------\n\nLoop, each time calling `cb(end, vars)` for function `end` and the variable\nstash with `this` set to a new chain for nested parsing. The loop terminates\nonce `end` is called.\n\nb.flush()\n---------\n\nClear the variable stash entirely.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nTo install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n```\nnpm install binary\n```\n\nnotes\n=====\n\nThe word64 functions will only return approximations since javascript uses ieee\nfloating point for all number types.

1595 silly resolved     readme: '# setImmediate.js\n**A YuzuJS production**\n\n## Introduction\n\n**setImmediate.js** is a highly cross-browser implementation of the `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate` APIs, [proposed][spec] by Microsoft to the Web Performance Working Group. `setImmediate` allows scripts to yield to the browser, executing a given operation asynchronously, in a manner that is typically more efficient and consumes less power than the usual `setTimeout(..., 0)` pattern.\n\nsetImmediate.js runs at “full speed” in the following browsers and environments, using various clever tricks:\n\n * Internet Explorer 6+\n * Firefox 3+\n * WebKit\n * Opera 9.5+\n * Node.js\n * Web workers in browsers that support `MessageChannel`, which I can\'t find solid info on.\n\nIn all other browsers we fall back to using `setTimeout`, so it\'s always safe to use.\n\n## Macrotasks and Microtasks\n\nThe `setImmediate` API, as specified, gives you access to the environment\'s [task queue][], sometimes known as its "macrotask" queue. This is crucially different from the [microtask queue][] used by web features such as `MutationObserver`, language features such as promises and `Object.observe`, and Node.js features such as `process.nextTick`. Each go-around of the macrotask queue yields back to the event loop once all queued tasks have been processed, even if the macrotask itself queued more macrotasks. Whereas, the microtask queue will continue executing any queued microtasks until it is exhausted.\n\nIn practice, what this means is that if you call `setImmediate` inside of another task queued with `setImmediate`, you will yield back to the event loop and any I/O or rendering tasks that need to take place between those calls, instead of executing the queued task as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are looking specifically to yield as part of a render loop, consider using [`requestAnimationFrame`][raf]; if you are looking solely for the control-flow ordering effects, use a microtask solution such as [asap][].\n\n## The Tricks\n\n### `process.nextTick`\n\nIn Node.js versions below 0.9, `setImmediate` is not available, but [`process.nextTick`][nextTIck] is, so we use it to shim support for a global `setImmediate`. In Node.js 0.9 and above, `setImmediate` is available.\n\nNote that we check for *actual* Node.js environments, not emulated ones like those produced by browserify or similar. Such emulated environments often already include a `process.nextTick` shim that\'s not as browser-compatible as setImmediate.js.\n\n### `postMessage`\n\nIn Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 9+, all modern WebKit browsers, and Opera 9.5+, [`postMessage`][postMessage] is available and provides a good way to queue tasks on the event loop. It\'s quite the abuse, using a cross-document messaging protocol within the same document simply to get access to the event loop task queue, but until there are native implementations, this is the best option.\n\nNote that Internet Explorer 8 includes a synchronous version of `postMessage`. We detect this, or any other such synchronous implementation, and fall back to another trick.\n\n### `MessageChannel`\n\nUnfortunately, `postMessage` has completely different semantics inside web workers, and so cannot be used there. So we turn to [`MessageChannel`][MessageChannel], which has worse browser support, but does work inside a web worker.\n\n### `<script> onreadystatechange`\n\nFor our last trick, we pull something out to make things fast in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 8: namely, creating a `<script>` element and firing our calls in its `onreadystatechange` event. This does execute in a future turn of the event loop, and is also faster than `setTimeout(…, 0)`, so hey, why not?\n\n## Usage\n\nIn the browser, include it with a `<script>` tag; pretty simple.\n\nIn Node.js, do\n\n```\nnpm install setimmediate\n```\n\nthen\n\n```js\nrequire("setimmediate");\n```\n\nsomewhere early in your app; it attaches to the global.\n\n## Demo\n\n* [Quick sort demo][cross-browser-demo]\n\n## Reference and Reading\n\n * [Efficient Script Yielding W3C Editor\'s Draft][spec]\n * [W3C mailing list post introducing the specification][list-post]\n * [IE Test Drive demo][ie-demo]\n * [Introductory blog post by Nicholas C.

This module is here to save the day. PullStream allows\nyou to pull data when you want and as much as you want.\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar PullStream = require(\'pullstream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar ps = new PullStream();\nvar loremIpsumStream = fs.createReadStream(\'loremIpsum.txt\');\nvar outputStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, \'loremIpsum.out\'));\n\nloremIpsumStream.pipe(ps);\n\n// pull 5 bytes\nps.pull(5, function(err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString(\'utf8\'));\n\n  //synchronously pull 1000 bytes or howevery many bytes are available\n  var bytes = ps.pullUpTo(1000);\n\n  // pipe the next 100 to a file\n  ps.pipe(100, outputStream).on(\'end\', function () {\n    console.log(\'all done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n# API Index\n\n## PullStream\n * [pull](#pullStreamPull)\n * [pullUpTo](#pullStreamPullUpTo)\n * [pipe](#pullStreamPipe)\n * [drain](#pullStreamDrain)\n * [write](#pullStreamWrite)\n * [end](#pullStreamEnd)\n * [prepend](#pullStreamPrepend)\n\n# API Documentation\n\n<a name="pullStream"/>\n## PullStream\n\n<a name="pullStreamPull" />\n### ps.pull([number], callback)\n\nCalls a callback when the specified number of bytes are ready. If no number is specified pull will read until the end\nof the input stream.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* number (optional) - Number of bytes to wait for. If not specified reads to the end of input stream.\n* callback(err, data) - Callback called when the bytes are ready. data is a buffer containing the bytes.\n\n__Example__\n\n```javascript\nvar ps = new PullStream();\n\nps.pull(5, function(err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString(\'utf8\'));\n});\n```\n\n<a name="pullStreamPullUpTo" />\n### ps.pullUpTo([number])\n\nSynchronously returns the specified number of bytes or however many bytes are available from the input stream. If no\nnumber is specified pullUpTo will return however many bytes are available from the input stream.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* number (optional) - Number of bytes to read from the input stream.\n\n__Example__\n\n```javascript\nvar ps = new PullStream();\n\nvar data = ps.pullUpTo(1000);\nconsole.log(data.toString(\'utf8\'));\n```\n\n<a name="pullStreamPipe" />\n### ps.pipe([number], destStream)\n\nPipes the specified number of bytes to destStream. If a number is not specified pipe will pipe the remainder\nof the input stream to destStream. Back-pressure is properly managed.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* number (optional) - Number of bytes to pipe.

1595 silly resolved     readme: 'Like FS streams, but with stat on them, and supporting directories and\nsymbolic links, as well as normal files.  Also, you can use this to set\nthe stats on a file, even if you don\'t change its contents, or to create\na symlink, etc.\n\nSo, for example, you can "write" a directory, and it\'ll call `mkdir`.  You\ncan specify a uid and gid, and it\'ll call `chown`.  You can specify a\n`mtime` and `atime`, and it\'ll call `utimes`.  You can call it a symlink\nand provide a `linkpath` and it\'ll call `symlink`.\n\nNote that it won\'t automatically resolve symbolic links.  So, if you\ncall `fstream.Reader(\'/some/symlink\')` then you\'ll get an object\nthat stats and then ends immediately (since it has no data).  To follow\nsymbolic links, do this: `fstream.Reader({path:\'/some/symlink\', follow:\ntrue })`.\n\nThere are various checks to make sure that the bytes emitted are the\nsame as the intended size, if the size is set.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nThis will create the directories if they\'re missing, and then write\n`hello\\n` into the file, chmod it to 0755, and assert that 6 bytes have\nbeen written when it\'s done.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          , flags: "a"\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nYou can pass flags in, if you want to append to a file.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/symlink"\n          , linkpath: "./file"\n          , SymbolicLink: true\n          , mode: "0755" // octal strings supported\n          })\n  .end()\n```\n\nIf isSymbolicLink is a function, it\'ll be called, and if it returns\ntrue, then it\'ll treat it as a symlink.  If it\'s not a function, then\nany truish value will make a symlink, or you can set `type:\n\'SymbolicLink\'`, which does the same thing.\n\nNote that the linkpath is relative to the symbolic link location, not\nthe parent dir or cwd.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Reader("path/to/dir")\n  .pipe(fstream.Writer("path/to/other/dir"))\n```\n\nThis will do like `cp -Rp path/to/dir path/to/other/dir`.  If the other\ndir exists and isn\'t a directory, then it\'ll emit an error.  It\'ll also\nset the uid, gid, mode, etc. to be identical.  In this way, it\'s more\nlike `rsync -a` than simply a copy.\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

Certain\nerrors are handled for you:\n\n* Windows: `EBUSY` and `ENOTEMPTY` - rimraf will back off a maximum of\n  `opts.maxBusyTries` times before giving up, adding 100ms of wait\n  between each attempt.  The default `maxBusyTries` is 3.\n* `ENOENT` - If the file doesn\'t exist, rimraf will return\n  successfully, since your desired outcome is already the case.\n* `EMFILE` - Since `readdir` requires opening a file descriptor, it\'s\n  possible to hit `EMFILE` if too many file descriptors are in use.\n  In the sync case, there\'s nothing to be done for this.  But in the\n  async case, rimraf will gradually back off with timeouts up to\n  `opts.emfileWait` ms, which defaults to 1000.\n\n## rimraf.sync\n\nIt can remove stuff synchronously, too.  But that\'s not so good.  Use\nthe async API.  It\'s better.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf installed with `npm install rimraf -g` it can be used as a global\ncommand `rimraf <path>` which is useful for cross platform support.\n\n## mkdirp\n\nIf you need to create a directory recursively, check out\n[mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp).\n',

In full mode, every\naction is recorded, which allows you to replay actions using the\n`jump()`, `trap()` and `down()` methods.\n\nHowever, if your chainsaws are long-lived, recording every action can\nconsume a tremendous amount of memory, so we also offer a "light" mode\nwhere actions are not recorded and the aforementioned methods are\ndisabled.\n\nTo enable light mode simply use `Chainsaw.light()` to construct your\nsaw, instead of `Chainsaw()`.\n\n\n',

Javascript port of python\'s\n[argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) module\n(original version 3.2). That\'s a full port, except some very rare options,\nrecorded in issue tracker.\n\n**NB.** Method names changed to camelCase. See [generated docs](http://nodeca.github.com/argparse/).\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\ntest.js file:\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\'use strict\';\n\nvar ArgumentParser = require(\'../lib/argparse\').ArgumentParser;\nvar parser = new ArgumentParser({\n  version: \'0.0.1\',\n  addHelp:true,\n  description: \'Argparse example\'\n});\nparser.addArgument(\n  [ \'-f\', \'--foo\' ],\n  {\n    help: \'foo bar\'\n  }\n);\nparser.addArgument(\n  [ \'-b\', \'--bar\' ],\n  {\n    help: \'bar foo\'\n  }\n);\nvar args = parser.parseArgs();\nconsole.dir(args);\n```\n\nDisplay help:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -h\nusage: example.js [-h] [-v] [-f FOO] [-b BAR]\n\nArgparse example\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.\n  -v, --version      Show program\'s version number and exit.\n  -f FOO, --foo FOO  foo bar\n  -b BAR, --bar BAR  bar foo\n```\n\nParse arguments:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -f=3 --bar=4\n{ foo: \'3\', bar: \'4\' }\n```\n\nMore [examples](https://github.com/nodeca/argparse/tree/master/examples).\n\n\nArgumentParser objects\n======================\n\n```\nnew ArgumentParser({paramters hash});\n```\n\nCreates a new ArgumentParser object.\n\n**Supported params:**\n\n- ```description``` - Text to display before the argument help.\n- ```epilog``` - Text to display after the argument help.\n- ```addHelp``` - Add a -h/–help option to the parser. (default: true)\n- ```argumentDefault``` - Set the global default value for arguments. (default: null)\n- ```parents``` - A list of ArgumentParser objects whose arguments should also be included.\n- ```prefixChars``` - The set of characters that prefix optional arguments. (default: ‘-‘)\n- ```formatterClass``` - A class for customizing the help output.\n- ```prog``` - The name of the program (default: `path.basename(process.argv[1])`)\n- ```usage``` - The string describing the program usage (default: generated)\n- ```conflictHandler``` - Usually unnecessary, defines strategy for resolving conflicting optionals.\n\n**Not supportied yet**\n\n- ```fromfilePrefixChars``` - The set of characters that prefix files from which additional arguments should be read.\n\n\nDetails in [original ArgumentParser guide](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html#argumentparser-objects)\n\n\naddArgument() method\n====================\n\n```\nArgumentParser.addArgument([names or flags], {options})\n```\n\nDefines how a single command-line argument should be parsed.\n\n- ```name or flags``` - Either a name or a list of option strings, e.g. foo or -f, --foo.\n\nOptions:\n\n- ```action``` - The basic type of action to be taken when this argument is encountered at the command line.\n- ```nargs```- The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed.\n- ```constant``` - A constant value required by some action and nargs selections.\n- ```defaultValue``` - The value produced if the argument is absent from the command line.\n- ```type``` - The type to which the command-line argument should be converted.\n- ```choices``` - A container of the allowable values for the argument.\n- ```required``` - Whether or not the command-line option may be omitted (optionals only).\n- ```help``` - A brief description of what the argument does.\n- ```metavar``` - A name for the argument in usage messages.\n- ```dest``` - The name of the attribute to be added to the object returned by parseArgs().\n\nDetails in [original add_argument guide](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html#the-add-argument-method)\n\n\nAction (some details)\n================\n\nArgumentParser objects associate command-line arguments with actions.\nThese actions can do just about anything with the command-line arguments associated\nwith them, though most actions simply add an attribute to the object returned by\nparseArgs(). The action keyword argument specifies how the command-line arguments\nshould be handled. The supported actions are:\n\n- ```store``` - Just stores the argument’s value. This is the default action.\n- ```storeConst``` - Stores value, specified by the const keyword argument.\n  (Note that the const keyword argument defaults to the rather unhelpful None.)\n  The \'storeConst\' action is most commonly used with optional arguments, that\n  specify some sort of flag.\n- ```storeTrue``` and ```storeFalse``` - Stores values True and False\n  respectively. These are special cases of \'storeConst\'.\n- ```append``` - Stores a list, and appends each argument value to the list.\n  This is useful to allow an option to be specified multiple times.\n- ```appendConst``` - Stores a list, and appends value, specified by the\n  const keyword argument to the list. (Note, that the const keyword argument defaults\n  is None.) The \'appendConst\' action is typically used when multiple arguments need\n  to store constants to the same list.\n- ```count``` - Counts the number of times a keyword argument occurs. For example,\n  used for increasing verbosity levels.\n- ```help``` - Prints a complete help message for all the options in the current\n  parser and then exits. By default a help action is automatically added to the parser.\n  See ArgumentParser for details of how the output is created.\n- ```version``` - Prints version information and exit. Expects a `version=`\n  keyword argument in the addArgument() call.\n\nDetails in [original action guide](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html#action)\n\n\nSub-commands\n============\n\nArgumentParser.addSubparsers()\n\nMany programs split their functionality into a number of sub-commands, for\nexample, the svn program can invoke sub-commands like `svn checkout`, `svn update`,\nand `svn commit`. Splitting up functionality this way can be a particularly good\nidea when a program performs several different functions which require different\nkinds of command-line arguments. `ArgumentParser` supports creation of such\nsub-commands with `addSubparsers()` method. The `addSubparsers()` method is\nnormally called with no arguments and returns an special action object.\nThis object has a single method `addParser()`, which takes a command name and\nany `ArgumentParser` constructor arguments, and returns an `ArgumentParser` object\nthat can be modified as usual.\n\nExample:\n\nsub_commands.js\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\'use strict\';\n\nvar ArgumentParser = require(\'../lib/argparse\').ArgumentParser;\nvar parser = new ArgumentParser({\n  version: \'0.0.1\',\n  addHelp:true,\n  description: \'Argparse examples: sub-commands\',\n});\n\nvar subparsers = parser.addSubparsers({\n  title:\'subcommands\',\n  dest:"subcommand_name"\n});\n\nvar bar = subparsers.addParser(\'c1\', {addHelp:true});\nbar.addArgument(\n  [ \'-f\', \'--foo\' ],\n  {\n    action: \'store\',\n    help: \'foo3 bar3\'\n  }\n);\nvar bar = subparsers.addParser(\n  \'c2\',\n  {aliases:[\'co\'], addHelp:true}\n);\nbar.addArgument(\n  [ \'-b\', \'--bar\' ],\n  {\n    action: \'store\',\n    type: \'int\',\n    help: \'foo3 bar3\'\n  }\n);\n\nvar args = parser.parseArgs();\nconsole.dir(args);\n\n```\n\nDetails in [original sub-commands guide](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html#sub-commands)\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- [Eugene Shkuropat](https://github.com/shkuropat)\n- [Paul Jacobson](https://github.com/hpaulj)\n\n[others](https://github.com/nodeca/argparse/graphs/contributors)\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 [Vitaly Puzrin](https://github.com/puzrin).\nReleased under the MIT license.

It uses the `minimatch`\nlibrary to do its matching.\n\n![](oh-my-glob.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar glob = require("glob")\n\n// options is optional\nglob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {\n  // files is an array of filenames.\n  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing\n  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]\n  // er is an error object or null.\n})\n```\n\n## Glob Primer\n\n"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on\nthe command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.\n\nBefore parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded\ninto a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any\nnumber of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain\nslash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.\n\nThe following characters have special magic meaning when used in a\npath portion:\n\n* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion\n* `?` Matches 1 character\n* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.\n  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches\n  any character not in the range.\n* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match\n  any of the patterns provided.\n* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided\n* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns\n  provided\n* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches\n  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.\n  It does not crawl symlinked directories.\n\n### Dots\n\nIf a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,\nthen it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern\'s\ncorresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.\n\nFor example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.\nHowever the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with\na dot character.\n\nYou can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting\n`dot:true` in the options.\n\n### Basename Matching\n\nIf you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no\nslashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree\nwith a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match\n`test/simple/basic.js`.\n\n### Negation\n\nThe intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to\nmatch everything that *doesn\'t* match the supplied pattern.  However,\nthe implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be\navoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.\n\n### Empty Sets\n\nIf no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This\ndiffers from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For\nexample:\n\n    $ echo a*s*d*f\n    a*s*d*f\n\nTo get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.\n\n### See Also:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])\n\nReturns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and\n`false` otherwise.\n\nNote that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in\nthe options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic\npattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`\nthen that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the\noptions.\n\n## glob(pattern, [options], cb)\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform an asynchronous glob search.\n\n## glob.sync(pattern, [options])\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform a synchronous glob search.\n\n## Class: glob.Glob\n\nCreate a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Glob = require("glob").Glob\nvar mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)\n```\n\nIt\'s an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches\nimmediately.\n\n### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])\n\n* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nNote that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will\nbe immediately available on the `g.found` member.\n\n### Properties\n\n* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There\n  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but\n  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.\n* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search\n  performed.\n* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible\n  values:\n  * `false` - Path does not exist\n  * `true` - Path exists\n  * `\'DIR\'` - Path exists, and is not a directory\n  * `\'FILE\'` - Path exists, and is a directory\n  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the\n    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`\n* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same\n  path multiple times.\n* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is\n  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.\n* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`\n  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated\n  Glob object, and may be re-used.\n\n### Events\n\n* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the\n  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,\n  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches\n  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.\n* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.\n* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever\n  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.\n* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `pause` Temporarily stop the search\n* `resume` Resume the search\n* `abort` Stop the search forever\n\n### Options\n\nAll the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to\nGlob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,\nor have glob-specific ramifications.\n\nAll options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll options are added to the Glob object, as well.\n\nIf you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object\nas the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some\n`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared\n`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that\nparallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about\nthe filesystem.\n\n* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults\n  to `process.cwd()`.\n* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted\n  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix\n  systems, and `C:\\` or some such on Windows.)\n* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.\n  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always\n  match dot files.\n* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be\n  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is\n  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.\n* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this\n  requires additional stat calls.\n* `nosort` Don\'t sort the results.\n* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance\n  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed\n  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.\n* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the\n  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.\n* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of\n  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these\n  cases.\n* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated\n  cache object to save some fs calls.\n* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent\n  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary\n  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the\n  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not\n  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)\n* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a\n  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when\n  resolving `**` matches.\n* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.\n* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the\n  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,\n  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this\n  flag to disable that behavior.\n* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set\n  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).\n* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.\n* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,\n  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)\n* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.\n* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on\n  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by\n  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.\n* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not\n  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as\n  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.\n* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.\n* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match\n  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of patterns to exclude matches.\n* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.\n  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the\n  presence of cyclic links.\n* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.\n  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute\n  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a\n  broken symlink)\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nNote that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,\nthough their contents may match against subsequent portions of the\npattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`glob.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n\n## Windows\n\n**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**\n\nThough windows uses either `/` or `\\` as its path separator, only `/`\ncharacters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use\nforward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always\nbe interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.\n\nResults from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the\nroot setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result\nin `/foo/*` matching `C:\\foo\\bar.txt`.\n\n## Race Conditions\n\nGlob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,\nsince it relies on directory walking and such.\n\nAs a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for\nit may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.\n\nAs part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat\nand readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system\noverhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,\nespecially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob\ncalls.\n\nUsers are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of\nfilesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority\nof operations, this is never a problem.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny change to behavior (including bugfixes) must come with a test.\n\nPatches that fail tests or reduce performance will be rejected.\n\n```\n# to run tests\nnpm test\n\n# to re-generate test fixtures\nnpm run test-regen\n\n# to benchmark against bash/zsh\nnpm run bench\n\n# to profile javascript\nnpm run prof\n```\n',

Can be used to\nsubmit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the\n[XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, you can use node\'s http\nclient interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (fs.readStream, http.response and mikeal\'s request), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\r\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\r\nincluded in its place.\r\n\r\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\r\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\r\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\r\n\r\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\r\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\r\n\r\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\r\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\r\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\r\n  to send an authenticated request), and\r\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\r\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\r\n\r\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\r\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\r\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\r\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\r\nand the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Replay Protection\r\n\r\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \r\nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \r\nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\r\n\r\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\r\nkey identifier combination. \r\n\r\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\r\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\r\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\r\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\r\n\r\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\r\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\r\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\r\nto a bad timestamp.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\r\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\r\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\r\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage Example\r\n\r\nServer code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Credentials lookup function\r\n\r\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\r\n\r\n    var credentials = {\r\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\r\n        user: \'Steve\'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return callback(null, credentials);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Create HTTP server\r\n\r\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\r\n\r\n    // Authenticate incoming request\r\n\r\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\r\n\r\n        // Prepare response\r\n\r\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\r\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\r\n\r\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\r\n\r\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\r\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\r\n\r\n        // Send the response back\r\n\r\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\r\n        res.end(payload);\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Start server\r\n\r\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Client credentials\r\n\r\nvar credentials = {\r\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\r\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Request options\r\n\r\nvar requestOptions = {\r\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\r\n    method: \'GET\',\r\n    headers: {}\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Generate Authorization request header\r\n\r\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\r\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\r\n\r\n// Send authenticated request\r\n\r\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\r\n\r\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\r\n\r\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\r\n\r\n    // Output results\r\n\r\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\r\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nHawk.sntp.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Protocol Example\r\n\r\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\r\nthe resource server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\r\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\r\n\r\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\r\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\r\n* Algorithm: sha256\r\n\r\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\r\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\r\ncharacter):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.header\r\n1353832234\r\nj4h3g2\r\nGET\r\n/resource?a=1&b=2\r\nexample.com\r\n8000\r\n\r\nsome-app-ext-data\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\r\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\r\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\r\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Payload Validation\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\r\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\r\n* `hawk.1.payload`\r\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\r\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\r\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\r\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\r\n\r\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.payload\r\ntext/plain\r\nThank you for flying Hawk\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich produces the following hash value:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.header\r\n1353832234\r\nj4h3g2\r\nPOST\r\n/resource?a=1&b=2\r\nexample.com\r\n8000\r\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\r\nsome-app-ext-data\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\r\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /resource/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\r\nand the nature of the data included.\r\n\r\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\r\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\r\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\r\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\r\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\r\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\r\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Response Payload Validation\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\r\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\r\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\r\n\r\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\r\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\r\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\r\n\r\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser Support and Considerations\r\n\r\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\r\n\r\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\r\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\r\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\r\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\r\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\r\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\r\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\r\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Single URI Authorization\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\r\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\r\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\r\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\r\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\r\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\r\nthe granted access timeframe. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Bewit Usage Example\r\n\r\nServer code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Credentials lookup function\r\n\r\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\r\n\r\n    var credentials = {\r\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return callback(null, credentials);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Create HTTP server\r\n\r\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\r\n\r\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\r\n\r\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\r\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n\r\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\r\n```\r\n\r\nBewit code generation:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Client credentials\r\n\r\nvar credentials = {\r\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\r\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Generate bewit\r\n\r\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\r\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\r\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Security Considerations\r\n\r\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\r\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\r\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\r\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\r\n\r\n### MAC Keys Transmission\r\n\r\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\r\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\r\n\r\n### Confidentiality of Requests\r\n\r\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\r\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\r\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\r\nto protect sensitive resources.\r\n\r\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\r\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\r\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\r\n\r\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\r\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\r\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\r\n\r\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\r\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\r\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\r\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n### Entropy of Keys\r\n\r\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\r\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\r\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\r\ncredentials are valid.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\r\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\r\nlongest key reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\r\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\r\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\r\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\r\n\r\n### Coverage Limitations\r\n\r\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\r\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\r\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\r\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\r\n\r\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \r\nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\r\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Future Time Manipulation\r\n\r\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\r\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\r\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\r\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\r\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\r\n\r\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\r\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\r\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\r\n\r\n### Client Clock Poisoning\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\r\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\r\nthat particular server.\r\n\r\n### Bewit Limitations\r\n\r\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\r\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\r\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\r\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\r\nand sensitive information.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n### Where is the protocol specification?\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\r\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\r\nsomething? Open an issue!\r\n\r\n### Is it done?\r\n\r\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\r\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\r\nand suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\r\n\r\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, others are actively porting it to other\r\nplatforms. There is already a [PHP](https://github.com/alexbilbie/PHP-Hawk),\r\n[.NET](https://github.com/pcibraro/hawknet), and [JAVA](https://github.com/wealdtech/hawk) libraries available. The full list\r\nis maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port). Please add an issue if you are working on another\r\nport. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\r\n\r\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\r\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\r\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\r\n\r\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\r\n\r\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\r\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\r\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\r\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\r\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\r\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\r\n\r\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\r\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\r\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\r\n\r\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\r\n\r\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\r\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\r\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\r\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\r\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\r\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\r\n\r\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\r\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\r\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\r\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\r\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\r\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\r\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\r\n\r\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\r\n\r\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\r\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\r\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\r\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\r\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\r\n\r\nShort answer: no.\r\n\r\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\r\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\r\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\r\nat work to produce more garbage.\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\r\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\r\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\r\n',

(Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

3349 silly resolved     readme: '# node-uuid\n\nSimple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Generate RFC4122 version 1 or version 4 UUIDs\n* Runs in node.js and all browsers.\n* Registered as a [ComponentJS](https://github.com/component/component) [component](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Components) (\'broofa/node-uuid\').\n* Cryptographically strong random # generation on supporting platforms\n* 1.1K minified and gzip\'ed  (Want something smaller?  Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )\n* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)\n* Comes with a Command Line Interface for generating uuids on the command line\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall it in your browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="uuid.js"></script>\n```\n\nOr in node.js:\n\n```\nnpm install node-uuid\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar uuid = require(\'node-uuid\');\n```\n\nThen create some ids ...\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a v1 (time-based) id\nuuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n\n// Generate a v4 (random) id\nuuid.v4(); // -> \'110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1\'\n```\n\n## API\n\n### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The randomly generated node id is only guaranteed to stay constant for the lifetime of the current JS runtime. (Future versions of this module may use persistent storage mechanisms to extend this guarantee.)\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v1({\n  node: [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab],\n  clockseq: 0x1234,\n  msecs: new Date(\'2011-11-01\').getTime(),\n  nsecs: 5678\n});   // -> "710b962e-041c-11e1-9234-0123456789ab"\n```\n\nExample: In-place generation of two binary IDs\n\n```javascript\n// Generate two ids in an array\nvar arr = new Array(32); // -> []\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 0);   // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 16);  // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15 02 a3 1c b0 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\n\n// Optionally use uuid.unparse() to get stringify the ids\nuuid.unparse(buffer);    // -> \'02a2ce90-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\nuuid.unparse(buffer, 16) // -> \'02a31cb0-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\n```\n\n### uuid.v4([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v4 UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nTo use the executable, it\'s probably best to install this library globally.\n\n`npm install -g node-uuid`\n\nUsage:\n\n```\nUSAGE: uuid [version] [options]\n\n\noptions:\n\n--help                     Display this message and exit\n```\n\n`version` must be an RFC4122 version that is supported by this library, which is currently version 1 and version 4 (denoted by "v1" and "v4", respectively). `version` defaults to version 4 when not supplied.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n> uuid\n3a91f950-dec8-4688-ba14-5b7bbfc7a563\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v1\n9d0b43e0-7696-11e3-964b-250efa37a98e\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v4\n6790ac7c-24ac-4f98-8464-42f6d98a53ae\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

Can be used to\nsubmit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the\n[XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, you can use node\'s http\nclient interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (fs.readStream, http.response and mikeal\'s request), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\r\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\r\nincluded in its place.\r\n\r\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\r\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\r\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\r\n\r\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\r\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\r\n\r\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\r\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\r\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\r\n  to send an authenticated request), and\r\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\r\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\r\n\r\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\r\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\r\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\r\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\r\nand the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Replay Protection\r\n\r\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \r\nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \r\nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\r\n\r\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\r\nkey identifier combination. \r\n\r\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\r\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\r\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\r\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\r\n\r\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\r\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\r\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\r\nto a bad timestamp.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\r\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\r\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\r\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage Example\r\n\r\nServer code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Credentials lookup function\r\n\r\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\r\n\r\n    var credentials = {\r\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\r\n        user: \'Steve\'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return callback(null, credentials);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Create HTTP server\r\n\r\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\r\n\r\n    // Authenticate incoming request\r\n\r\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\r\n\r\n        // Prepare response\r\n\r\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\r\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\r\n\r\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\r\n\r\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\r\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\r\n\r\n        // Send the response back\r\n\r\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\r\n        res.end(payload);\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Start server\r\n\r\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Client credentials\r\n\r\nvar credentials = {\r\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\r\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Request options\r\n\r\nvar requestOptions = {\r\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\r\n    method: \'GET\',\r\n    headers: {}\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Generate Authorization request header\r\n\r\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\r\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\r\n\r\n// Send authenticated request\r\n\r\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\r\n\r\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\r\n\r\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\r\n\r\n    // Output results\r\n\r\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\r\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nHawk.sntp.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Protocol Example\r\n\r\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\r\nthe resource server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\r\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\r\n\r\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\r\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\r\n* Algorithm: sha256\r\n\r\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\r\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\r\ncharacter):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.header\r\n1353832234\r\nj4h3g2\r\nGET\r\n/resource?a=1&b=2\r\nexample.com\r\n8000\r\n\r\nsome-app-ext-data\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\r\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\r\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\r\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Payload Validation\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\r\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\r\n* `hawk.1.payload`\r\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\r\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\r\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\r\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\r\n\r\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.payload\r\ntext/plain\r\nThank you for flying Hawk\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich produces the following hash value:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhawk.1.header\r\n1353832234\r\nj4h3g2\r\nPOST\r\n/resource?a=1&b=2\r\nexample.com\r\n8000\r\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\r\nsome-app-ext-data\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\r\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /resource/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com:8000\r\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\r\nand the nature of the data included.\r\n\r\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\r\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\r\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\r\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\r\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\r\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\r\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Response Payload Validation\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\r\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\r\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\r\n\r\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\r\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\r\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\r\n\r\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser Support and Considerations\r\n\r\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\r\n\r\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\r\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\r\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\r\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\r\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\r\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\r\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\r\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Single URI Authorization\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\r\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\r\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\r\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\r\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\r\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\r\nthe granted access timeframe. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Bewit Usage Example\r\n\r\nServer code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Credentials lookup function\r\n\r\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\r\n\r\n    var credentials = {\r\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return callback(null, credentials);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Create HTTP server\r\n\r\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\r\n\r\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\r\n\r\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\r\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n\r\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\r\n```\r\n\r\nBewit code generation:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\r\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Client credentials\r\n\r\nvar credentials = {\r\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\r\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\r\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Generate bewit\r\n\r\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\r\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\r\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Security Considerations\r\n\r\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\r\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\r\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\r\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\r\n\r\n### MAC Keys Transmission\r\n\r\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\r\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\r\n\r\n### Confidentiality of Requests\r\n\r\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\r\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\r\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\r\nto protect sensitive resources.\r\n\r\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\r\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\r\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\r\n\r\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\r\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\r\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\r\n\r\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\r\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\r\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\r\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n### Entropy of Keys\r\n\r\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\r\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\r\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\r\ncredentials are valid.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\r\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\r\nlongest key reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\r\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\r\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\r\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\r\n\r\n### Coverage Limitations\r\n\r\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\r\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\r\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\r\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\r\n\r\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \r\nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\r\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Future Time Manipulation\r\n\r\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\r\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\r\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\r\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\r\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\r\n\r\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\r\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\r\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\r\n\r\n### Client Clock Poisoning\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\r\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\r\nthat particular server.\r\n\r\n### Bewit Limitations\r\n\r\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\r\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\r\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\r\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\r\nand sensitive information.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n### Where is the protocol specification?\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\r\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\r\nsomething? Open an issue!\r\n\r\n### Is it done?\r\n\r\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\r\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\r\nand suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\r\n\r\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, others are actively porting it to other\r\nplatforms. There is already a [PHP](https://github.com/alexbilbie/PHP-Hawk),\r\n[.NET](https://github.com/pcibraro/hawknet), and [JAVA](https://github.com/wealdtech/hawk) libraries available. The full list\r\nis maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port). Please add an issue if you are working on another\r\nport. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\r\n\r\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\r\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\r\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\r\n\r\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\r\n\r\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\r\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\r\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\r\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\r\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\r\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\r\n\r\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\r\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\r\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\r\n\r\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\r\n\r\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\r\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\r\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\r\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\r\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\r\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\r\n\r\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\r\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\r\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\r\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\r\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\r\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\r\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\r\n\r\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\r\n\r\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\r\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\r\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\r\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\r\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\r\n\r\nShort answer: no.\r\n\r\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\r\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\r\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\r\nat work to produce more garbage.\r\n\r\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\r\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\r\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\r\n\r\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\r\n',

Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nTo use the executable, it\'s probably best to install this library globally.\n\n`npm install -g node-uuid`\n\nUsage:\n\n```\nUSAGE: uuid [version] [options]\n\n\noptions:\n\n--help                     Display this message and exit\n```\n\n`version` must be an RFC4122 version that is supported by this library, which is currently version 1 and version 4 (denoted by "v1" and "v4", respectively). `version` defaults to version 4 when not supplied.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n> uuid\n3a91f950-dec8-4688-ba14-5b7bbfc7a563\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v1\n9d0b43e0-7696-11e3-964b-250efa37a98e\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v4\n6790ac7c-24ac-4f98-8464-42f6d98a53ae\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

3817 silly resolved     readme: '# mime\n\nComprehensive MIME type mapping API. Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project, plus additional types submitted by the node.js community.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install mime\n\n## API - Queries\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\nGet the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `path` (the substring after the last \'/\' or \'.\').  E.g.\n\n    var mime = require(\'mime\');\n\n    mime.lookup(\'/path/to/file.txt\');         // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'file.txt\');                  // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'.TXT\');                      // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'htm\');                       // => \'text/html\'\n\n### mime.default_type\nSets the mime type returned when `mime.lookup` fails to find the extension searched for. (Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

If the node is in an Array it will\nbe spliced off. Otherwise it will be deleted from its parent.\n\nthis.delete()\n-------------\n\nDelete the current element from its parent in the output. Calls `delete` even on\nArrays.\n\nthis.before(fn)\n---------------\n\nCall this function before any of the children are traversed.\n\nthis.after(fn)\n--------------\n\nCall this function after any of the children are traversed.\n\nthis.pre(fn)\n------------\n\nCall this function before each of the children are traversed.\n\nthis.post(fn)\n-------------\n\nCall this function after each of the children are traversed.\n\nmethods\n=======\n\n.map(fn)\n--------\n\nExecute `fn` for each node in the object and return a new object with the\nresults of the walk. To update nodes in the result use `this.update(value)`.\n\n.forEach(fn)\n------------\n\nExecute `fn` for each node in the object but unlike `.map()`, when\n`this.update()` is called it updates the object in-place.\n\n.reduce(fn, acc)\n----------------\n\nFor each node in the object, perform a\n[left-fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function))\nwith the return value of `fn(acc, node)`.\n\nIf `acc` isn\'t specified, `acc` is set to the root object for the first step\nand the root element is skipped.\n\n.deepEqual(obj)\n---------------\n\nReturns a boolean, whether the instance value is equal to the supplied object\nalong a deep traversal using some opinionated choices.\n\nSome notes:\n\n* RegExps are equal if their .toString()s match, but not functions since\nfunctions can close over different variables.\n\n* Date instances are compared using `.getTime()` just like `assert.deepEqual()`.\n\n* Circular references must refer to the same paths within the data structure for\nboth objects. For instance, in this snippet:\n\n````javascript\nvar a = [1];\na.push(a); // a = [ 1, *a ]\n\nvar b = [1];\nb.push(a); // b = [ 1, [ 1, *a ] ]\n````\n\n`a` is not the same as `b` since even though the expansion is the same, the\ncircular references in each refer to different paths into the data structure.\n\nHowever, in:\n\n````javascript\nvar c = [1];\nc.push(c); // c = [ 1, *c ];\n````\n\n`c` is equal to `a` in a `deepEqual()` because they have the same terminal node\nstructure.\n\n* Arguments objects are not arrays and neither are they the same as regular\nobjects.\n\n* Instances created with `new` of String, Boolean, and Number types are never\nequal to the native versions.\n\n.paths()\n--------\n\nReturn an `Array` of every possible non-cyclic path in the object.\nPaths are `Array`s of string keys.\n\n.nodes()\n--------\n\nReturn an `Array` of every node in the object.\n\n.clone()\n--------\n\nCreate a deep clone of the object.\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nUsing npm:\n    npm install traverse\n\nOr check out the repository and link your development copy:\n    git clone http://github.com/substack/js-traverse.git\n    cd js-traverse\n    npm link .\n\nYou can test traverse with "expresso":http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso\n(`npm install expresso`):\n    js-traverse $ expresso\n    \n    100% wahoo, your stuff is not broken!\n\nhash transforms\n===============\n\nThis library formerly had a hash transformation component. It has been\n[moved to the hashish package](https://github.com/substack/node-hashish).\n',

4558 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instanting the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n## Functions\n\nThe top-level exported function has a `cache` property, which is an LRU\ncache set to store 100 items.  So, calling these methods repeatedly\nwith the same pattern and options will use the same Minimatch object,\nsaving the cost of parsing it multiple times.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

If you have no idea what ASN.1 is,\nsee this: ftp://ftp.rsa.com/pub/pkcs/ascii/layman.asc\n\nThe source is pretty much self-explanatory, and has read/write methods for the\ncommon types out there.\n\n### Decoding\n\nThe following reads an ASN.1 sequence with a boolean.\n\n    var Ber = require(\'asn1\').Ber;\n\n    var reader = new Ber.Reader(new Buffer([0x30, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0xff]));\n\n    reader.readSequence();\n    console.log(\'Sequence len: \' + reader.length);\n    if (reader.peek() === Ber.Boolean)\n      console.log(reader.readBoolean());\n\n### Encoding\n\nThe following generates the same payload as above.\n\n    var Ber = require(\'asn1\').Ber;\n\n    var writer = new Ber.Writer();\n\n    writer.startSequence();\n    writer.writeBoolean(true);\n    writer.endSequence();\n\n    console.log(writer.buffer);\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install asn1\n\n## License\n\nMIT.\n\n## Bugs\n\nSee <https://github.com/mcavage/node-asn1/issues>.\n',

Its name comes from the C header file.\n\nTo get started, simply clone the repository or use npm to install it. Once it is\nthere, simply require it.\n\ngit clone git://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype\nnpm install ctype\nvar mod_ctype = require(\'ctype\')\n\n\nThere are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction you\'d like.\nThe low level API let\'s you read and write individual integers and floats from\nbuffers. The higher level API let\'s you read and write structures of these. To\nillustrate this, let\'s looks look at how we would read and write a binary\nencoded x,y point.\n\nIn C we would define this structure as follows:\n\ntypedef struct point {\n\tuint16_t\tp_x;\n\tuint16_t\tp_y;\n} point_t;\n\nTo read a binary encoded point from a Buffer, we first need to create a CType\nparser (where we specify the endian and other options) and add the typedef.\n\nvar parser = new mod_ctype.Parser({ endian: \'big\' });\nparser.typedef(\'point_t\', [\n\t{ x: { type: \'uint16_t\' } },\n\t{ y: { type: \'uint16_t\' } }\n]);\n\nFrom here, given a buffer buf and an offset into it, we can read a point.\n\nvar out = parser.readData([ { point: { type: \'point_t\' } } ], buffer, 0);\nconsole.log(out);\n{ point: { x: 23, y: 42 } }\n\nAnother way to get the same information would be to use the low level methods.\nNote that these require you to manually deal with the offset. Here\'s how we\'d\nget the same values of x and y from the buffer.\n\nvar x = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 0);\nvar y = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 2);\nconsole.log(x + \', \' + y);\n23, 42\n\nThe true power of this API comes from the ability to define and nest typedefs,\njust as you would in C. By default, the following types are defined by default.\nNote that they return a Number, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n    * int8_t\n    * int16_t\n    * int32_t\n    * int64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * uint8_t\n    * uint16_t\n    * uint32_t\n    * uint64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * float\n    * double\n    * char (either returns a buffer with that character or a uint8_t)\n    * char[] (returns an object with the buffer and the number of characters read which is either the total amount requested or until the first 0)\n\n\nctf2json integration:\n\nNode-CType supports consuming the output of ctf2json. Once you read in a JSON file,\nall you have to do to add all the definitions it contains is:\n\nvar data, parser;\ndata = JSON.parse(parsedJSONData);\nparser = mod_ctype.parseCTF(data, { endian: \'big\' });\n\nFor more documentation, see the file README.old. Full documentation is in the\nprocess of being rewritten as a series of manual pages which will be available\nin the repository and online for viewing.\n\nTo read the ctio manual page simple run, from the root of the workspace:\n\nman -Mman -s 3ctype ctio\n',

4774 silly resolved     readme: '# node-assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node\'s assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, \'myArg\')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require(\'assert-plus\');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, \'options\');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, \'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, \'options.isManager\');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, \'options.name\');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, \'options.email\');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, \'callback\');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren\'t* part of node\'s core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string \'name\' that\'s not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, \'foo\');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don\'t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
